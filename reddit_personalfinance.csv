I’m finally doing better but since I was unable to work and have been forced to live in a very toxic/abusive living situation while trying to get my health together, which has made things harder.

IRA Rollover Reinvestment,XipeToltec,0,0.5,6,2025-09-13 11:03:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nfzqlq/ira_rollover_reinvestment/,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nfzqlq/ira_rollover_reinvestment/,I changed employers and rolled over my old 401k into an IRA and it all was converted to cash. I need to reinvest it back into index funds but this seems like a DCA situation as the market is around record levels and there is still a decent amount of uncertainty. Does anyone have any advice on structuring a DCA like this? I'm considering a 3 to 6 month timeline with maybe weekly buys. I am more trying to get a gut check than anything.
