"You never did covered calls and got forced to sell?

Kudos."
Hahah that‚Äôs what happening to me right now. I had to roll out to November. I think I‚Äôm screwed.
What strike? This mf gonna keep running. So I hope the CCs aren‚Äôt on your whole position
"$10 and $8‚Ä¶.

Yeah I fucked up. I did it when it was $5ish thinking I was safe. I‚Äôll have to get out somehow"
"This is exactly me. Just had to roll out my 8.50s to November. I knew it was going to go up, just didn‚Äôt expect this quickly lol"
"I was anticipating next week. I held off thinking well shit they would‚Äôve announced the ceo by now. It was at $5ish yesterday. I was like cool should be safe and a quick premium. 30 mins. It‚Äôs an oh fuck why‚Äôd I do that.

I‚Äôm just gonna have to accept my fate but I‚Äôm wondering if it ever drops during the timespan then if I could just go down and in (hopefully at a credit) and exit the trade. I‚Äôm fully anticipating I‚Äôm either gonna have to accept my profit (assuming it‚Äôs there) or paying a debit to exit the trade."
"At the end of the day, profit is profit. At least it‚Äôs not a loss right?"
Rolled out to November‚Ä¶we‚Äôll see what happens.
I have an option expiring tomorrow I don't wanna do lol what is rolling out?
Lmfaoooooo
"""What is rolling out"" got me lmao. Bro is the reason behind all the disclamers about buying options on the trading apps"
"It's fun money for me, I'm just here to learn y'all chill"
You sold a lottery ticket and it hit. You can pay them their winnings and sell another ticket to the next gambler.
"Call or put? Anyway. YouTube is your friend. 

Calls roll the trade up in price and/or out in expiration (I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre like me and it ain‚Äôt gonna help much atm). 

Puts us the opposite 

*im a regard and am not responsible for whatever happens to your monies. Aka not financial advice."
Rolling is where you get to pay someone else mucho dinero for the luxury of keeping your own shares. Better hope it keeps climbing or it‚Äôs gonna sting.
So the other option is just to close out your positions and take the profits or am I wrong?
Look up rolling ur call option
I rolled to Dec 2027.
"At what strike? 

The balancing act here to me is if you think it‚Äôs going go up way past $10-15 then the option chain doesn‚Äôt let me go past around $12."
"As the price rises, they will write more contracts at higher strikes.¬† Be patient, I am in the same situation at 12c"
üíéü§ö
Lmfao one of us
How exactly does covered calls work?
"Selling calls = bearish
Selling puts = bullish

OPEN is not a stock you‚Äôd want to be selling calls on because the strike price is the price that you sell at. And with the sentiment around this stock you‚Äôre basically guaranteed to be selling at a loss relative to the share price"
Except I bought at 0.78 and sold $3 calls for .40. Only 1000 shares. Basically in for free. Then did 1000 more at 5 with $9 calls at 1.15 a contract. It‚Äôs been fun
You own the shares you are selling the calls on.
"And when the options go ITM, the bank takes away your share"
99% of the time it's only on expiration day
Or you don‚Äôt own the shares and you can be in for a surprise lol
Then it's not a covered call...
"Nah, it's definitely covered

*visibly sweating*"
naked and afraid
Those premiums were very sweet... RIP. I got shaken out last week and have been to much a coward to chase it.
"Options millionaire


Never selling.¬†


Options expire. He broke"
If you never sell then you're not a millionaire
"He's going to multi off of this.

MULTI üöÄ"
MULTIPASS?
Leeloo Dallas Mooty pass.
then elon isn't a billionaire
Yeah but Elon‚Äôs fortune is far more likely to stick around then this guys tbh.
I'm never selling
Coward.
lol millionaire coward
Too scared to buy a million in OPEN puts ha!
"So what are you going to do with all your unrealized gains, keep posting screenshots until you lose it all?"
Alr under a million
At least pull out your original investment
Gotta have some folding money to 0 day with
"If you didn't have these right now, would you buy them for $1 million dollars? If not, sell."
ü´°
You‚Äôre gonna be a millionaire 10 times over if you hold this cunt til 27
Why sell when it could be 10 mil
You should sell a little‚Ä¶just $100k in cash flow would change your life
"Yeah you right, even $200k!

Take some shit out and enjoy the sunshine"
Can borrow against it.
You can leverage the stock to get a loan like Elon and other billionaires
"Congrats ‚Ä¶Please make it count for retail and take some profits and as always 
Fuck you 

ü§òüèø"
He should cut 50% of his position and then hold the rest until next year December
Thanos didn't stop at one infinity stone. He kept going
"Yeah and if he stopped he wouldn‚Äôt have died, but go conquer the universe brah"
retire the bloodline
You degenerate
"Congrats dude. Jealous af lol. 
What convinced you to go all in?"
"&gt;My roommate worked at Opendoor.

hmmmmmmmmmmm"
No way did he admit to insider trading lmao
cant delete replies LMAO
Say what?
insider trading
"This DD sounds legit, I'm all in!"
What did he say
That his roommate worked at opendoor lmao
"$821,000 return in a $1.06 million position, means you put upwards of $200,000 into this penny stock in the first place.

Which would lead me to believe OPEN is not your first time being a millionaire."
he admitted to insider trading lol
"Having a roommate who works there who says it's a good company and they recommend investing is not insider trading.¬† It isn't even insider trading if the employee buys it.¬† It's only when an insider has privileged information (not public knowledge) that is reasonably expected to affect the price when it becomes known, and they trade off of that information."
"If his friend just recommended that OPEN is good to invest, a normal person wouldn't immediatelly sell all other positions he has to put all in OPEN, that has to be insider traiding.

OP said that he sold all positions, NVDA, VOO, etc., no one sane in the head would do that ever!"
Bro really made it look easy. Gratz!
I just closed my eyes and sucked it out a hose
Damn you really admitted to insider trading that‚Äôs crazy LOL
Well son of a bitch‚Ä¶. Clean af honestly nice one dude. I had 100 call contracts for January 2027. Would be up 90k right now. I sold for 8k profit. If I had full ported like you when I saw this play I would have about 3 million.
Could also have $0. It‚Äôs all a gamble gains are gains
Thanks king
I had 100 contracts at .50 Jan 2027. sold today for 8.80 lost a bit but happy with 87k profit.
"Nice job brother, that‚Äôs about my exact position. I got in a little later though, 1.28 per contract. Sold for 2.35 or something like that. Lol. Ah well, money is money, whatever. Way to hold on."
Yeah I sold for 10k profit on the first big pump oh well FUCKKK
"Owned ~25k shares $1.45 avg for the last few years, sold at ~$3 after the first meme dump. FNMA being up 3700% helps ease the pain tho"
"With this stock, I be thinking about the King of the Hill episode where everyone invests in Boomhauer's pig business and Hank questions the validity of the business and think it's a stupid idea. Then it starts doing super well and everyone's rich. Hank goes against everything he said, gets FOMO, and decided to buy in with his retirement money right before it tanks."
‚ÄúI‚Äôm never selling‚Äù waiting for the loss porn
"Man this is amazing, how do you guys have so much conviction"
it takes retarded to make retarded amounts of money
"But seriously, did you have any previous knowledge regarding the stock because fundamentals are horrid‚Ä¶

What gave you the hard-on for this stock?"
"July 18 my text to a friend said ""if you want to gamble on a meme run check out OPEN."" 

I bought and sold within the week or something and moved on."
"I did the same shit. Stared at this stock for a week when it was being shilled back in July. Decided not to degen into it and am obviously sulking in it now. What ever I guess. Win some, lose some, miss some."
"I remember when someone posted about it on here when it was 70 cents. I was close to buying, but decided against it.  I stand by that decision -  the company is dogshit - but damn if seeing is go up to 15 times what I could have bought it at doesn‚Äôt sting."
i put in $15 and now i have $60 :)
I'm vibe trading from now on
All trading is vibe trading.
Lemme know what the next one with vibes is please lol
It was cheap. Funny name. There's a lot of buzz. What more do you need??
Wise words thank you
"Balls of steel, that‚Äôs how. I chickened out at like $1.90, I try not to think about it too much"
Well he had 200k to blow so
Step 1 : start with 200k?
a lot of people have 200k but only very few would fully port into a shit stock.
~~shit~~ GROWTH stock
Lmao
Cost basis buddies! I only have 500 shares but we're the same you and I
Never selling so what‚Äôs the point? This is basically the same as losing it all
"Right?? Yeah, I have a safe full of gold bars. Use them??? No I‚Äôll never use them"
That's the weird thing about saving in general. Basically everyone tries to maximize the amount they have when they die rather than trying to end up at 0 on the day you die.
"Why is you not celling? , I tells you - please cell"
A million is cool but do you know what‚Äôs cooler? 10 million‚Ä¶
"If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to sell"
Can I have $600 to pay my wife‚Äôs boyfriend back?
Let me pay for my fiance's lashes first. and I'll see what's left over
"Damn bro, we got in on the SAME date although my cost was 1.99 and only measly 2500 shares compared to your big balls.  Grats all the same"
What is open?
a terrible company
"You‚Äôre never selling?

You never lose taking a profit bro."
"With a sprinkle of alleged insider knowledge, he just couldn‚Äôt help but tell his regarded fam (us) about this. ü§°"
How the fk u find this kind of stock
It's mostly luck.
Very nice! I'm 400% on some $1 calls expiring on Jan 27 I got when open was selling for a dollar.
"Bruh you have $1 calls and you're only up 400%, how?"
probably bought them whilst they were deep itm
Bought them for 1.63 when it was \~$2 after it went to almost $5. And actually up 483%
Leaps were literally free money. It was like a $0.50 difference between 10/2025 and 1/2027 calls
"You are now richer than many old fucks that's been slaying away at their corporate jobs for past 20-30 years. 

This is why ppl need to invest in stocks."
I believe all $OPEN army gonna be millionaires !
I hate myself. Had 1700 shares acquired at $1.69. Sold them all at $3.50. I‚Äôm a retard.
100% gains on a meme stonk? It's good profits! Don't second guess yourself fren!
"You‚Äôre right but all my brain sees now is the ‚ÄòIf only‚Äô after seeing the jump today. That extra $15,000 would have made a big difference in my life."
There is always another play! Even if the play is VOO and chill!!;
Tap out and get help for that gambling addiction
If this is a significant part of your net worth and you don't sell you're making an awful mistake. That's life changing money for most people. Be smart.
People don‚Äôt throw around the word retarded here for no reason lol

Put a trailing stop. This thing is going to crater.
Sell some Jesus
$239K in shares? Seems you may have been a millionaire prior to this.
Except now you‚Äôre not anymore because it tanked today
"&gt;I'm never selling.

Can't wait to see the post where you lose everything"
Please lock in some profit. Im so happy for you. Lots of people lost on other investments. Just lock in something (at least what you put in.
I've realized about 150k in profits. going to take my mom and dad to bora bora

"Big W for you. Please bail me out of my $5,000 loss today üòî"
This could have been me but I sold üò≠üò≠üò≠
Wow. I still regret not getting in at 78 cents a little bit ago. This was a huge gamble and I wish I had the kuhanas to make a move like this lol. Congrats.
sell 1/4 at least
If you bought calls with that you could‚Äôve retired today.
"Honestly I‚Äôd sell Jan 16 ‚Äò26 1000 12c covered calls. Worst case you‚Äôre capped on profits and still a millionaire then some. In the high likelihood of a pullback on the current news because no matter what the new CEO can do it won‚Äôt come to fruition in a year or two, that extra 330k is some sweet income."
Not bad for a day's work.
fuck you. congratulations\\
Imagine being an OPEN ber
"its down 9% AHs , what is yours showing ?"

Get your initial investment back then hold as long as you want.
