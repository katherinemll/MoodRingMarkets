wow i had no idea margaret had a sister who's drop dead gorgeous as well
I was surprised for a sec and then remembered who their mum is. Their dad is pretty good looking too.
both former models. yeah this checks out.
TIL that they‚Äôre Andie Mcdowell‚Äôs daughters
She‚Äôs got a very small part in an episode of Mad Men and every single rewatch I‚Äôm taken aback by how gorgeous she is. (The fur coat episode for anyone curious.)
I never get jealous of beautiful women but when that scene came on I almost asked my boyfriend to close his eyes lol. Striking beauty!
Omg! I didn't know that but always have the same thought when I watch the episode
She is the furcoat-wearing young woman in _Mad Men_!
Like stunning. I‚Äôm shook by how beautiful she is.
She‚Äôs in a new movie with armie hammer. She‚Äôs not worth knowing
Rain &gt; Margo
The Qualley/MacDowell genes are insane
"Truly! I love Andie's comments on aging, but the jerk in me is like, ""Well yeah, if I looked like you, aging would definitely be easier!""

  
But yes, gorgeous kids."
"Same. It's like hearing a someone with a good paying job say ""find a job you enjoy doing and you'll never work a day in your life"" while you're working a deadend job, that cynical ""I mean...you're right and I'm happy for you but...no one grew up wanting to be a wastewater operator""."
No but if you're a wastewater operator the world would plummet into chaos and disease without you
"That's the point; most of people don't do jobs they love but are required. The world needs factory workers, fast food workers, garbage collectors, etc. As the saying goes; it takes hundreds of people to put on a great concert but even if they all wanna be the one on stage, there can be only one person performing while everyone else keeps it running smoothly."
"I used to think that. 

Then I realized that, as a model whose looks are so *intrinsically* entwined with how people (in the entertainment industry especially) value you, aging would be much much harder than it is for those of us who are ‚Äúaverage.‚Äù

I find models who allow themselves to age naturally inspirational in this way. Andie included."
I like that way of thinking!
"I mean, her daughter starred in a movie that made that exact point, so‚Ä¶"
"Nobody likes getting ugly lol. Hollywood people are all drama queens and love whining from mansions. I have zero sympathy for someone who spent 40 odd years having everything handed to them because of how they look when they finally see how other people live (not poor people obs, but average people.)"
Pretty people just be living totally different lives
"Conversely though‚Ä¶in her line of work, ANY kind of aging for a woman reduces her employability hugely.   

It‚Äôs a much bigger deal for an actress to say Fuck It to fighting nature than to, say, a woman who‚Äôs a corporate lawyer or kindergarten teacher."
Yeah it‚Äôs hard to take it seriously coming from her even though I agree
I think the first thing out of my mouth when I saw these photos was damn Andie good job creating two gorgeous kids.
"Dad was a model too, I think Rainey favors him, and Margaret, Andie."
Is it me or does she kind of look like she could be related to Angelina jolie?
They did a really good job casting young Dell (Andie‚Äôs character) in the Way Home.
"There's another Qualley?? And wait, is that Bill Pullman's son??"
Yes and yes
I thought who is Lewis Pullman then I scrolled lol. I figured that‚Äôs who his father is.
After seeing The Testament of Ann Lee no one can convince me Lewis Pullman isn't an absolute babe
"Well, I loved his Dad in While You Were Sleeping.

  
I sound 100 years old."
"I'm 35 so I'm in that weird gap where I crushed on his dad growing up, and now I'm crushing on the son who is in the same age-ish range as me."
39 and same here.
"Monica and the two Dr. Burkes.

""That's not how your dad did it."""
Bill P has been my ride or die since Spaceballs. I guarantee I‚Äôm older than you. üòÅ
I'm in my early 40s but mature lovers of Bill P unite!
He was so charming in Thunderbolts.
Bob üò≥
"I liked him way back in Bad Times at The El Royale ü´£

To be fair, though, I think it was because his character was the only thing I liked about that film."
Did you see at Venice? Thought it was one of the films of all time
"Looks like this is her husband now

https://preview.redd.it/e31jfx88klof1.jpeg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53dae02aa705e1c4849e788f39d7a78dfe66e801"
"Jfc. To all the McDowells too, they have next level genes. Ugh, and this guy looks like a ‚ÄúMad Men‚Äù esq detective and one of the extremely rare men that can pull off the upper lip mustache lol"
I‚Äôm a little bit annoyed at how pretty they are. Can you imagine looking like that? I‚Äôd be such a fucking diva.
Looks like she chose John Walker over Bob
Idk if they are married but they are engaged and have a daughter.
"My claim to fame is that I went to college with Lewis Pullman, he was in my \~170 person graduating class and Bill Pullman was at my graduation. We weren't friends but we had mutual friends and he was very nice. He majored in social work. When he pops up in films or online I'm like this:

![gif](giphy|kd9BlRovbPOykLBMqX)"
lol mine is that I did community children‚Äôs theatre with him as kids and he kissed my best friend
Yooo! He did theater in college too haha.
"His brother always seemed to have more artistic talent. For example, all those puppets he made."
He went to my college too! But graduated before I got there. Wasn‚Äôt he in a band or something?
"Lewis? Or his brother Jack? I think Jack may have played an instrument, I don‚Äôt really remember."
"I thought Jack was, though I may be misremembering."
Always weird seeing someone talk about Wilson in the wild üòÖ Lewis taught me how to drive a tractor
!! You are my people! I love that. Farm crew?
I was hvac and then landscaping
"lol I have a friend who was talking about how Lewis from his college had become famous and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwell yeah, he‚Äôs Bill Pullman‚Äôs kid‚Äù and he had no idea"
Another Qualley to add to the radar. She's gorgeous.
"Not just gorgeous but interesting to look at, both her and Margaret have such uniquely beautiful faces"
She's kind of weird though. There was a whole drama where she was accused of exploiting a homeless woman over guardianship of a baby
I forgot about that! It was even mentioned in this sub¬†https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1cm1kgz/margaret_qualleys_sister_rainey_accused_of/
Margaret was in one of her music videos 'love me like you hate me' (trigger warning for Shia LaBeouf)
Actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf?
She‚Äôs gonna be in armie hammers new movie. Might wanna take her off the radar
"It's funny seeing Armie brought up right after reading ""Actual cannibal Shia Leboeuf?"" right above it lol. It was like a jump scare with an ~~actual~~ alleged cannibal"
"Incidentally, she's married now with a child."
Yes. I believe so
Did they get married or just engaged?
i don't know
He was so good in Thunderbolts.
He was pretty good I was pleasantly surprised by that movie.
He was also very good in Lessons in Chemistry!
i *loved* him in Lessons in Chemistry! he's a real charmer
I just finished the book and I couldn‚Äôt stop crying üò≠ I‚Äôm afraid to watch the show
I *loved* him in Bad Times at the El Royale
He was thunder tastic
Hot people being hot ü•µ
Lewis Pullman has...pull.
his dad is my celeb crush. I don‚Äôt watch independence day for the plot
I always say one of my biggest failures in life is being too young for Bill and too old for Lewis. Everyone was all about Devon Sawa in Casper when it came out but I was only watching for Dr. Harvey üò≠
"üíØ

The glasses, the sweaters, the soft hair, his sweet Dad voice...  hell yess!!!"
Saaaaaame. He's so good in that movie. A hot and moral president...a good dad and those forearms. Would.
While You Were Sleeping was a gamechanger for young me.
The LEAN
It‚Äôs about wanting‚Ä¶ and accepting‚Ä¶ ü•µ
excuse me while I go watch this movie that I‚Äôve never seen. my fianc√© just sat down to watch big brother but that‚Äôs gotta wait. thanks bestie
"I am actually jealous of what you are about to experience for the first time.

![gif](giphy|QoDgkKih9OWvEdZw2j)"
My other fav to watch around the holidays ü•π
I watched that movie and immediately watched it over again. Swoon!
Independence Day has a plot?!?!
The plot is ‚Äòwelcome to earth!‚Äô
It was NEWSIES that did it for me.
Bill as Lone Starr in Spaceballs... ü•µü•µü•µ
![gif](giphy|jvDoTnTeDXeI62hpk6|downsized)
There‚Äôs something about him. I had no opinion of him  until Thunderbolts and suddenly I was like ‚Äúwait who is this? what is this feeling?‚Äù
God they‚Äôre hot
both v good looking!!!!!
Something about the first photo looks somewhat ‚Äúvintage‚Äù I thought he was his dad. Thanks lady with the smartphone in the back for forcing me to read the title of the post.
It‚Äôs giving 90s vibes.
She is unreasonably good looking and that photo specifically made me think Courtney Cox in the early to mid 90s. Just stunning.
Yeaah I had no idea who these people are and I thought it's a picture from the 70s
He has his dads whole face. I think it‚Äôs so cute when that happens.
bob????
"If it wasn‚Äôt for the smartphone in the background that first picture looks like it‚Äôs from the 90‚Äôs, threw me for a loop"
Rainey**
That‚Äôs her name but she goes by Rain as a singer
No she goes by Rainsford as a singer but otherwise goes by Rainey. She doesn‚Äôt go by Rain
She actually goes by Rainsford as a singer ‚ò∫Ô∏è Rainey personally. I‚Äôve followed her for years (she‚Äôs a Realisation Par ‚Äúdreamgirl‚Äù/model) and never seen her go by Rain.
Thank you! I‚Äôm getting attacked for explaining that she goes by Rainey
I know what her legal name is but she goes by Rainey publicly. She has never publicly gone by Rain
Are you friends with her?
No but I have a friend that went to NCSA with Margaret and is friends with Margaret and so she also knows Rainey and she goes by Rainey or Rainsford for her music. She doesn‚Äôt go by Rain. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with correcting someone to call them by what their name is
"That‚Äôs never been a name she has publicly gone by. Her IG is Rainey and she introduces herself as Rainey, that‚Äôs clearly the name she prefers to go by. When Margaret has talked about her in interviews she calls her Rainey. 

Why don‚Äôt we just call people by the name they introduce themselves as instead of calling her something she‚Äôs never publicly gone by? I‚Äôm not going to call Margaret - Maggie Qualley cause that‚Äôs not her name or what she has ever indicated she wanted to go by.

It should not be a controversial concept to call people by the name they prefer to be called"
i am so confused as to why they were arguing with you. i read through this thread and ended up flabberghasted üòÇ
You‚Äôre the one arguing about calling someone by a name that isn‚Äôt their name. Maybe you‚Äôre bored i don‚Äôt know
Damn those Qualley face cards NEVER decline.
Honestly I think she's more beautiful than her sister ü´£
Yes. She was a model
Holy shit he's his Dad's dopplelganger
"I see more Andrew McCarthy

https://preview.redd.it/oyoe88ojanof1.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2a11e676e8544401ecbd7453ecee8c0c7c6c8b6"
Isn‚Äôt that sentry?
Yes
https://preview.redd.it/o0lm5ul04nof1.jpeg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658cbdd3c8f710aa195aec00671563dff927c5cb
Since they are both nepo babies I can explain it to you using their parents who you will probably know: the guy is bill Pullman son (the actor who played the president in Independence Day). He is an actor who had his break out role this year in a marvel movie. She is the daughter of Andie Macdowell. The model and actress from the 90s (she was in four weddings and a funeral). They used to date but broke up and now he is dating Kaia gerber the daughter of Cindy Crawford (the famous model from the 90s)
"Blessing upon you, my child. 

And now I cannot *not* see Bill Pullman!"
Yeah he looks so much like his father
First thought is wow this is an attractive couple‚Ä¶geez
"I believe her name is actually Rainsford and she goes by Rainey

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainey_Qualley"
"Spaceballs!

![gif](giphy|PXGvUV7Znz5wQ)"
he makes my heart flutter in Lessons in Chemistry
There‚Äôs an even hotter Qualley????
Stop. There is too much beauty within this post. I can't see
"Can I just say that if someone on reddit suddenly posted a bunch of pictures of me and my ex and people commented on my relationship I‚Äôd crash out.

(I do welcome the second part tho, my ex is a meanie)"
Hot nepo babies¬≤
Her and Margaret have the same smile.
RAINSFORD IS A QUALLEY HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS SHE DID HER ROUNDS ON MY TUMBLR BACK IN THE DAY
The nepo grandbabies that could have been
"He‚Äôs dating Kaia Gerber now, there‚Äôs still hope for nepo grandbabies lol"
A second Qualley?
There‚Äôs another Qualley???
First photo and the two in black &amp; white look like they were taken in the 70s which utterly confused me for a second.
https://preview.redd.it/ha7q109lumof1.jpeg?width=387&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1840f48a515a4239e9b72d387291fa42e851325
Not the point but how do you have one daughter named (Sarah) Margaret and one named Rainsford? Lol
Whatever he is so fine and she‚Äôs hot
Is that Bob?
Rainey*. And she just had a beautiful baby girl so these genes will bless our eyeballs for at least another generation.
Hope her daughter doesn‚Äôt follow in her footsteps and make a movie with a cannibalistic rapist
Yikes‚Ä¶who?
Rainey is starring alongside armie hammer in his ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù film‚Ä¶that man deserves a lot of things but a Hollywood comeback is not one of them
That‚Äôs one lucky dude.
Never heard of either of these people??
Should we all RSVP yes to [their wedding](https://www.zola.com/wedding/raineyandtony)? Lol
"I know everyone is focused on how gorgeous Rainey is, and rightfully so, but can we talk about what a cutie Lewis is, and how he's the spitting image of his dad?!"
insane genes in that family
Are they really forgotten if no one knew who they were?
"I never forgot, her ig fed me for a while üòÖ"
I've never heard of either of them
Nepos of romcom royalty
He's done a load of indie films but you'd probably 'know' him from Marvel's Thunderbolts or Top Gun 2.
"Hard to forget people you‚Äôve never even known about, lol."
she and twin shadow were cute together
Yes. That was before Lewis
there‚Äôs something so 2000s about the first pic that i thought she was gonna be andies sister
Wow she‚Äôs beautiful
Kinda looks like Meghan from mad men
She was on an episode of mad man actually
She should play Loretta Lynn in a biopic
OH MY GOD!! God really does have favorites.
"Her name is Rainey not Rain, apparently short for Rainsford"
Two very contrasting naming styles with Rain and Margaret.
She looks like a really pretty version of that dropout actor
And her full name is Rainsford
I've never seen Rain before but she's very pretty!
Forgotten couple? Never heard of either of these ppl lol
"Forgotten couple?, it's a bit more like forgotten people?, I'm really struggling to recognize this pop culture makers that seem to have a status above ""normal"" people, if wonder, is it the nepo status that automatically awards you a famous person tag?, it's a very interesting question and not a all a low effort thought.

Life can feel futile sometimes, like a cycle of chasing things that don‚Äôt last: success, recognition, status. Being famous might look like the pinnacle, but it often just puts a spotlight on the same loneliness, confusion, or emptiness everyone else feels. At the end of the day, fame doesn‚Äôt fill the void or make the hard questions go away. Maybe the real substance of life isn‚Äôt in being known by millions, but in being understood by a few or even just understanding yourself. Maybe we all are famous in someway"
