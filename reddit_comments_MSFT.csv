"I saw someone else describe the Oracle OpenAI deal as Company with no cloud infrastructure sells cloud for $400b to company with no money. Summed it up for me."
"I worry about margins, yes revenues might increase, but will they be able to maintain margins?  There is lots of competition among hyper-scaler cloud providers."
"Amazon and I’m sure other big companies are notorious for this. Pay a little more than building it yourself and offload all the risk. Oracle has to ensure uptime, buy all the chips, and source all the electricity.

Used to work at a company that had Amazon as a customer. We’d get a fuck ton of revenue, but the catch was they’re probably using this to copy us and buy time for them to build their own infrastructure.

We didn’t care because we’d be dumb to turn down all the money.. 3 years later they copied us and then dropped us as a customer. 

They did the same to UPS shipping and data infrastructure is probably next."
"We've put export restrictions on China using nVidia Blackwell while offering them weaker boards that may have trackers and kill switches - which their government tells their companies not to use. Oracle builds AI datacenters in countries around the world, some in Asia.

So if you're a Chinese company, how do you train your models on Blackwell? Well, you take your data to another country, rent AI cloud servers, and then return back to China as a way to circumvent export controls."
Oracle has been one of the largest most successful companies for decades. Not sure this surge is anything other than people underestimating the stock bc it isn’t a Mag 7.
