Returns here represent the market cap-weighted average for each GICS sector. Each stock’s contribution is calculated as its return multiplied by its market cap, then divided by the total market cap of the sector. This method reflects the performance of each sector as influenced by the size of its individual constituents.

X-axis shows 5-day return. Y-axis shows 1-month return. Bubble size reflects the total sector market cap.
