https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/13/trump-fed-lisa-cook-appeals-court.html,Fed governor Cook asks appeals court to reject White House's bid to remove her from Fed board,"Lisa Cook, governor of the US Federal Reserve and governor nominee for US President Joe Biden, during a Senate Banking Committee nomination hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, June 21, 2023.Anna Rose Layden | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is asking a U.S. appeals court to reject the Trump administration's latest bid to remove her from her post ahead of the central bank's next vote on interest rates.In a filing with the court Saturday, attorneys on behalf of Cook asked the court to refuse an emergency request by the Trump administration for a stay of a lower court ruling that would clear the way for PresidentDonald Trumpto remove Cook from the Federal Reserve's board of governors.Lawyers for Cook argue that the Trump administration has not shown sufficient cause to fire her, and stressed the risks to the economy and country if the president were allowed to fire a Fed governor without cause.""A stay by this court would therefore be the first signal from the courts that our system of government is no longer able to guarantee the independence of the Federal Reserve. Nothing would then stop the president from firing other members of the board on similarly flimsy pretexts. The era of Fed independence would be over. The risks to the nation's economy could be dire,"" according to the filing.The court has given the Trump administration the option to respond to Cook's filing by 3 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.At stake is whether the Trump administration will succeed in its extraordinary effort to shape the board before the Fed's interest rate-setting committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday. At the same time, Senate Republicans are pushing to confirm Stephen Miran, Trump's nominee to an open spot on the Fed's board, which could happen as soon as Monday.Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claimtwo propertiesas ""primary residences"" in July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them were declared as a rental property or second home.Cook has denied the charges and sued the Trump administration to block her firing.On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb ruled the administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired ""for cause,"" which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed's board until 2022.The administration then appealed the decision and asked for an emergency ruling reversing the lower court order by Monday. In their emergency appeal, Trump's lawyers argued that even if the conduct occurred before Cook's time as governor, her alleged action ""indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy.""If the Trump administration's appeal succeeds, Cook would be removed from the Fed's board until her case is ultimately resolved in the courts, and she would miss next week's Fed meeting, when the central bank is set to decide whether to reduce its key interest rate.If the appeals court rules in Cook's favor, the administration could seek an emergency ruling from the Supreme Court.The Fed is under relentless pressure from Trump to cut rates. The central bank has held rates steady since late 2024 over worries that the Trump administration's unpredictable tariff policies will reignite inflation.Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that Fed officials are increasingly concerned about weaker hiring, setting the stage for a rate cut next week. Most economists expect the Fed will cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to about 4.1%.When the Fed reduces its key rate, it often, over time, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. Some of those rates have already fallen in anticipation of cuts from the Fed.",
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/uranium-market-heats-up-on-nuclear-revival-hopes.html,The uranium boom is back as demand for nuclear surges,"A revival of nuclear energy is spurring demand for uranium, as the hunt for fuel reshapes the investment landscape. Described as ""the heavenly atom ,"" uranium and its concentrated energy are essential for fueling nuclear reactors. After years of skepticisim following the Fukushima disaster of 2011, a growing need for large, reliable supplies of power to support the world's AI boom has brought nuclear energy — and the fuel required for it — back into the spotlight. Demand for uranium is forecast to rise by nearly a third to roughly 86,000 tons by 2030 and to rise to 150,000 tons by 2040, according to a report released by the World Nuclear Association last week. In addition to the vast amounts of capital that are required to realize the sector's nuclear hopes, data also showed that accelerated permitting, mining innovations and new explorations of uranium will need to take place to meet growing demand. Output from existing mines is expected to halve between 2030 and 2040, resulting in a ""significant gap"" between uranium requirements for nuclear reactors and production volumes, the WNA report said. ""The demand signals are there"" Mahesh Goenka, founder of market and commercial advisory firm Old Economy, told CNBC. The world has gone from the West looking to shut down capacity to it now extending reactor lifetimes beyond 2050, he said. ""The big leg up would come if the order book for new nuclear reactors in the West will start firming up... If the West can indeed build a big pipeline of reactor projects, that would mean demand for uranium grows much more rapidly than in the current scenario,"" he said. Boosting supply The uranium market is widely exposed to geopolitical tensions due to sources of the supply. Kazakhstan continues to lead global production with 40% of global supply, of which the country owns around half, according to Old Economy. Meanwhile Russia has around 40% of the world's enrichment capacity. There's ""momentum in the industry which we have not seen for decades,"" Boris Schucht, CEO of uranium enrichment firm Urenco, told CNBC on the sidelines of the World Nuclear Association symposium last week. He added that the seven to 10-billion-euro ($8.2 billion to $11.8 billion) market is seeing steady annual growth of 1-2%. ""It's a small growing market. It's a limited market, [that's] not very big, and it's very expensive to develop technologies in this market. So that makes the market pretty complex,"" he said. The Dutch-British-German consortium conducted the ""expensive exercise"" of terminating all of its existing Russian contracts in 2022 when the Russia-Ukraine war started, Schucht said. The company is now looking to increase its capacity of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) by 1.8 million Separative Work Units (SWU) across its four sites in Eunice, New Mexico, the Netherlands, Germany and the U.K. ""From now on, we will bring new capacity into the market, starting in the U.S., but then the Netherlands and Germany will follow. What we have also seen is that most of our, especially our U.S., customers, were requesting very long term contracts."" Other companies are also looking to increase supply in the U.S. The Uranium Energy Corporation (UEC) last week announced it will launch a subsidiary firm to develop a new Stateside uranium refining and conversion facility. Back in July, Eagle Energy Metals, which touts itself as the first U.S. company to explore uranium with Small Modular Reactor (SMR) tech, announced its plans to go public. Last week, French firm Orano shared plans to expand capacity in anticipation of post-""peak uranium"" years. Burgeoning market Old Economy predicts a perceptible drop in existing uranium projects and supply in the second half of the 2030s due to depletion. Work must start now, for supply to then be made available. Those efforts include exploration, better understanding of resource bases and getting licenses and permitting underway. ""There's a lot for miners to work through, both in terms of understanding the resource base, understanding the flow sheets, and developing the studies, but then also getting the stakeholder support in terms of licensing and social license to operate,"" Goenka said, noting that uranium, as a commodity, lacks advanced management systems when it comes to managing price risk. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) introduced a futures contract for uranium in 2007, but the endeavor has had little success, due to a lack of liquidity, according to Goenka. Last year, Trilitech launched the uranium.io platform which uses blockchain technology to enable trading of tokenized uranium. The goal is to open up the market which is traditionally dominated by institutional investors, Ben Elvidge, head of applications at uranium.io, told CNBC at the WNA symposium. ""If you take apart the demand as it stands right now, there was already a shortfall of uranium last year to power the current fleet. That gap makes it, like any commodity investment, interesting,"" said Elvidge. Early demand came from traders looking to diversify their portfolio of crypto assets, Elvidge said. He added that they've also seen interest from traditional investors such as hedge funds and family offices, who might not be familiar with the nuclear thesis, but understand the fundamentals around uranium and don't want to have the operational burden of trading larger amounts of uranium. Regardless of new developments, Urenco's Schucht urged caution when it comes to tech involvement in the market, telling CNBC that the current momentum should be harnessed jointly with the government in order to achieve what has been pledged. ""We need to be careful the nuclear market stays the nuclear market, and it will be not a [quickly] exploding tech market [as] the processes that you have in nuclear, around nuclear safety, design and planning, will not allow for that,"" the CEO said, adding that he was skeptical about the ability of the nuclear industry, with its long cycles, to support short-term solutions from the tech sector. ""I strongly believe the market of [small modular reactors] and [advanced modular reactors] will play their role, but it will take time,"" he said.",
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/07/digital-gold-could-soon-shake-up-londons-precious-metal-markets.html,Digital gold could soon shake up London’s precious metal markets,"London's $930-billion gold market could be set for a ""transformative"" shake-up, as the World Gold Council (WGC) looks to digitalize the metal. On Wednesday, the WGC — a trade body that represents the gold industry — launched a proposal for the roll-out of Pooled Gold Interest (PGI) tokens backed by physical gold bars held in London, which could be used to trade bullion and use it as collateral. The tradeable PGIs would give market participants legally enforceable ownership of vaulted gold and allow traders to buy fractions of 400-ounce bars for the first time, according to Mike Oswin, global head of market structure and innovation at the WGC. ""This is a way to be able to get into the get into the market, hold a digital representation of gold with full legal [entitlement], with full confidence that that the gold is there,"" he said. ""It can be used simply for investments. It can be used for collateral. We believe this will increase participation in the market because of the new use cases that it's going to open up,"" he told CNBC in a call on Wednesday. The gold market has already seen a surge in demand this year, with market volatility, rising geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic jitters sending prices to record highs . 'A third pillar' Amid that rising demand, Oswin told CNBC that the WGC wanted to create ""a third pillar"" in addition to the existing two ways of trading gold. Gold trades are currently settled with either allocated or unallocated gold. The former settlement involves direct ownership of specific gold bars or coins. Unallocated gold — the most widely traded form of gold in the world — gives investors a claim to a certain quantity of gold, rather than ownership of specific bars. In this case, the investor is exposed to any credit risks linked to the institution holding the gold. If the institution goes bankrupt, there is no guarantee the investor's claim on the gold will be fulfilled. ""The key objective of this initiative in phase one is to give gold the mobility it needs to be pledged as a financial collateral,"" Oswin said. Allocated gold is accepted as a form of financial collateral in many markets, but Oswin explained that, because of the logistical difficulties involved with transferring physical bars between vaults, ""it is never used,"" and bonds or cash are usually favored instead. ""We want to place gold as a financial asset alongside those types of collateral,"" Oswin told CNBC. ""So pledging gold will become just as simple as pledging a kind of digitally native bond or cash."" While the initial focus will be on digitalizing gold for use as collateral, the PGIs also have scope to make the gold market more accessible in other ways, Oswin added. Asked whether the PGIs could one day be used to settle futures contracts, he expressed optimism. ""In a future state, one could look and say, if the PGI is flowing freely around the market as collateral being exchanged between parties … would it be a huge step to say that there could be futures contracts that use this as the actual settlement mechanism?"" he said. ""[It's] not flagged as the core objective of ours, but potentially in the future, you could see that as one of the opportunities for sure."" The Loco London gold market — a reference to gold bullion physically held in vaults in the U.K. capital — amounted to 8,776 tonnes of gold valued at $927.5 billion as of June 30, WGC data shows. The London market clears an average 20 million ounces in daily trade, according to the WGC — but the trade body's outlook for digital gold goes even further. ""At the moment, this is U.K. focused,"" Oswin said during Wednesday's call. ""[But] of course, it will travel — that is the ambition. And so we are looking at other jurisdictions and how this will work in the U.S. and [elsewhere]."" In a white paper released this week, the WGC laid out its Vision Statement for digital gold, describing its proposal as ""a unique opportunity to reshape the current landscape."" Physical asset allure However, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, argued the response to a digital form of gold may receive a lukewarm or even negative response from market participants. ""The WGC may feel this is an important development, as it seeks to maintain relevance for itself and the precious metal in a world where cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are currently in favour,"" he explained in an email. ""[But] real gold bugs may not care, may not see the point or may even be alarmed."" Mould noted that the appeal of the metal to gold bulls was that it remained a physical asset, and that its supply increased slowly in a world where ""money supply can rocket at the push of a button."" ""They wish to shun financial complexity, opacity and leverage – the terrible trio, the confluence of which tends to be found at the root of any event which prompts both volatility and a loss of confidence,"" he told CNBC. ""They are just the sort of events from which gold bugs are seeking protection.""",

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/12/european-defense-venture-capitals-mission-to-rearm-the-continent.html,Defense startups are booming as VCs race to rearm Europe,"European defense startups are attracting swathes of private capital, as investors look for exposure to an industry on the cusp of receiving a leg-up from massive rearmament plans. Pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump , the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and widespread geopolitical instability culminated in commitments from the European Union and the U.K. this year to drastically ramp up defense spending. Meanwhile, members of the NATO military alliance agreed over the summer to raise their security spending targets to 5% of gross domestic product. Defense investment landscape 'unrecognisable' Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, private capital has been pouring into European defense firms. According to a February report from Dealroom and the NATO Innovation Fund — a venture capital fund backed by 24 NATO member states — VC investments in European defense and security startups surged to a record $5.2 billion in 2024, while the overall VC market in the region shrank. ""Appetite for defence, security and resilience startup investment is unrecognisable in Europe from just a few years ago,"" Dealroom's CEO Yoram Wijngaarde said in the report. There's no sign that that appetite is slowing down. Loredana Muharremi, equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC the trend had accelerated further this year, alongside a surge in investor demand for publicly listed defense companies. ""We've seen a step change in Europe's private defence market since 2022, with a sharp acceleration in the first half of 2025,"" she said in an email, noting that the driver this year was NATO's new spending target. ""Not only are overall investment volumes in dollar terms rising, but also per-deal value is higher, pointing to higher valuations."" Muharremi added that the nature of the deals had also shifted, from M & A-led bolt-on acquisitions to VC investment. ""Private capital is playing a critical role in bridging the gap between early-stage prototypes and mainstream defense adoption,"" she added. According to Morningstar's analysis, the majority of European defense startups are software-driven and AI-enabled, with a focus on drones, cybersecurity and space — innovation areas outside the core remit of many legacy defense firms. ""Another important trend is the growing role of U.S. investors, especially in later-stage venture rounds, which is providing the capital needed to scale,"" Muharremi added. One U.S. investor taking an interest in the European defense space is Scout Ventures, a Texas-based VC firm with a focus on early-stage startups. ""Historically, the main market for dual-use or defense-focused organizations was the United States,"" Cody Huggins, a partner at Scout and former U.S. army officer, told CNBC on a call. ""The U.S. just had a massive budget, and was the market to be in — now it's really shifted to what I would call four main hubs, Europe being one of those."" Huggins said Southeast Asia and the Gulf states were also emerging as focal points of defense tech innovation. ""Where the money is, you're going to have folks fall, and so you're going to see high-caliber entrepreneurs that otherwise wouldn't have built in this space because they would be concerned that there weren't the contracts or the venture capital or growth equity in Europe,"" he added. ""And that paradigm has shifted dramatically with the increase [in regional budgets]."" 'The pot of gold is larger' European VC investors also told CNBC the defense sector was increasingly a focal point for the region's own capital. Archie Muirhead, a partner at British VC firm IQ Capital, said that since 2005, up to a third of IQ's portfolio companies have been defense-focused or dual-purpose firms. That positioning was based on companies' merits — more recently, however, it has been actively seeking out firms whose technology can be used for security purposes. ""In the last two, three years, we've started to make defense-first or defense-only investments across Europe,"" Muirhead said on a call. ""We started to see founders building in defense who had the right mentality to match VC outcomes. It's partly because of emotional, mission-driven [founders], and partly the fact that the pot of gold is larger and more accessible in Europe now."" IQ Capital was an early participant in the U.K.'s National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF), the British government's corporate ventures arm, which works with investors to fund startups building dual-use defense technologies. But amid the hype around European defense, Muirhead conceded that the exit trajectory for many startups in the sector remains shrouded in uncertainty. ""We haven't seen the first wave of new defense company exits yet,"" he said. ""We've seen the first set of very small bolt-on acquisitions, [but] those are not being based on revenue, they're more based on strategic fit. The way we approach it is, is there white space in terms of overall capability, and could that become a multi-product, multi-platform, multinational business? If it could, then there's clearly a path to going public, or a financial exit rather than a strategic exit."" While some VCs like IQ Capital have pivoted to focus more intently on defense, others are being set up in Europe purely to hunt for opportunities in the sector. Among them is U.K.-based Defence Invest, a VC firm set up in 2024 by a five-person team that collectively has over 60 years' experience in the British and German armed forces. Co-founder Matt Kuppers served in the German army until last year, and is now a member of the reserve forces. He told CNBC that Defence Invest's on-the-ground military experience had helped it identify capability gaps and supply bottlenecks in European defense – and it was looking to startup ""hotspots"" in Munich, the U.K., Ukraine and eastern Europe for investment opportunities. ""The market is still highly underfunded, and there's plenty of opportunities for venture capital firms,"" he said, pointing to areas like security communications – for example, the development of ""jamming"" capabilities that disrupt drone signals — as well as battery technologies and the supply of critical defense components. But VCs should be prepared to wait for their investments to pay off, according to Kuppers, with the ramping up of defense spending still a relatively new phenomenon. ""It will actually take a while until the huge influx of capital really starts taking hold and having an impact,"" he said. ""I would expect for this to happen in the next two to three years or so, until we see a large and significant increase in defense innovation."" Europe 'standing on its own two feet' Something startups should lean into is their nimbleness compared to the large defense primes, Kuppers said, which gives up-and-coming firms an advantage in competing for new government contracts. ""Startups can innovate pretty fast. They can do a lot of DIY,"" he told CNBC. ""They're not bound to certification and compliance regulations, at least not during the R & D phase. So, I think that defense tech startups can contribute significantly to defense innovation at scale in Europe."" One young company that already has government contracts is British data protection startup Valarian. Its most recent funding round of $7 million was co-led by Artis Ventures, an early backer of Palantir. It brought total funding raised by the five-year-old company to $20 million. Co-founder and CEO Max Buchan told CNBC that Europe currently offered an ""interesting arbitrage opportunity."" ""We raise not [just] capital from the U.S., but also that level of knowledge and experience for deploying capital, and take that to Europe and start deploying because we're in this great time of geopolitical shifts,"" he said. ""NATO governments ... they're not buying products, they're not buying technologies — what they are buying is capabilities."" ""We see this across the board in Europe,"" he added. ""For the first time in a very long time, Europe really standing on its own two feet when it comes to spending allocation and sourcing of these types of technologies."" But although the geopolitical landscape continues to benefit European companies, IQ Capital's Muirhead noted that they will still be competing with their — often much bigger and more established — U.S. rivals for government contracts. It's led some European defense primes to argue that increased budgets should be allocated to companies headquartered in the region, while the EU's rearmament plans have instructed member states to prioritize European firms . ""There for sure is a kind of temporary 'buy local,' top-down view ... particularly in segments like space and communications, where, if it gets switched off, you're completely isolated or on your own,"" Muirhead said. ""[But] I think the idea that U.S. tech won't be procured in Europe is slightly overblown. I think the winds will shift back and forth on that as as the [transatlantic] relationship is clarified and ironed out.""",

Retail stocks led gains, up 1.65%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStoxx 600 index.Investors are keeping a close eye on France on Monday, as French Prime Minister Francois Bayrouis widely expected to lose a confidence vote. Bayrou called for the vote himself after ongoing wrangling with rival political parties over around 44 billion euros ($51.5 billion) worth of budget cuts.Bayrou's aim was to bring France's budget deficit down to 4.6% in 2026 — a level still well above the European Union's deficit rules — but opposition parties have objected to spending cuts and tax rises in equal measure. If Bayrou is ousted on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron will have to name the country's fifth prime minister in less than two years.French prime minister faces the axe as lawmakers prepare to hold confidence voteIn equity markets, Dutch semiconductor companyASMLhas reportedly invested 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) into French startup Mistral AI's 1.7 billion euro fundraise.Elsewhere, London-listed insurance groupPhoenixsaid it will rebrand as Standard Life, a heritage brand it owns, from March 2026.Asia-Pacific marketstraded mostly higher on Monday, as investors assessed Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement over the weekend and eyed key economic data in the region.U.S. stockswere also higher with two critical inflation reports expected this week: the U.S. producer price index report for August is due on Wednesday morning, followed by the consumer price index on Thursday.The inflation prints will be coming in after weaker-than-expected hiring data on Friday, which helped fuel investor hope that the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to lower benchmark interest rates at its policy meeting later this month.",

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/13/cautious-optimism-led-stocks-back-to-all-time-highs-but-are-bulls-becoming-irrationally-exuberant.html,Cautious optimism led stocks back to all-time highs. But are bulls becoming irrationally exuberant?,"""Triumph of the Optimists"" is a landmark history of investment returns during the 20th century. The story of past several weeks in markets could be called, ""Redemption of the Cautious Optimists."" From the start of August, after a startling weak jobs report, the markets locked into investors' preferred scenario: The Federal Reserve would soon lower interest rates — but not because the real economy is in need of urgent help. This allowed a somewhat extended equity rally as of the end of July to flatten out, cooling off overheated momentum stocks, offering relief to the lagging sectors, suppressing volatility, draining away some excess investor optimism and extending the S & P 500's run without as much as a 3% pullback beyond four months. This week's mix of elevated but as-expected CPI inflation and a possibly fluky uptick in weekly unemployment claims cemented the outlook for an easier Fed while preserving the prevailing view that the underlying economy is steady or better. In this crowd-pleasing version of reality, the soggy-seeming labor market is providing markets and policy makers with ""just the right amount of wrong,"" as the old advertising catchphrase for a Las Vegas casino hotel put it. Once one believes that the stalled jobs market is either an anomaly (due to immigration crackdowns, demographics and a sharp but fading tariff-driven confidence shock among companies), it's a quick hop to deciding that the Fed next week will embark on ""good news rate cuts."" It also allows an investor to argue that Treasurys have rallied hard — dropping yields to five-month lows — for good reasons. And that gold is roaring to new records not because the Fed is losing credibility or systemic macro risk is rising, but because institutions are prudently diversifying away from the dollar as the fiscal taps open wide across the world. Credit markets, for their part, offer testimony in favor of this theory, betraying minimal concern about economic stress or corporate solvency, with high-yield debt spreads near their most compressed readings of this cycle, Bespoke Investment Group notes, on ""the assumption Fed rate cuts will support activity without much fear over damaging inflation, and investment grade-rated assets are showing the same optimism."" Economists and many investors have been sensitive to a possible ""stagflationary"" mix of factors, which if they worsened could vex markets and confuse policy makers. In short, at this moment, this refers to sticky, above-target inflation coexisting with slowing underlying growth and weakening employment. This is the dynamic no one wishes to see gain traction from here, though current levels of inflation between 2.5% and 3% are pretty unremarkable looking back a few decades, easily handled by equity markets so long as they don't provoke a tighter Fed. And in absolute terms, the starting point is relatively benign, as gauged by the ""misery index,"" simply the sum of the unemployment rate and CPI. Are we there yet? The market action itself is not serving up many persuasive causes for acute concern. The S & P 500's breakout to new highs on Thursday after the CPI and weekly jobless claims releases was broad, led by the kind of cyclical-bellwether groups one might hope to see out ahead (homebuilders, semiconductors, small-caps, equal-weight indexes, banks). The bulls have also anchored to the limited but reassuring history of periods when the Fed cut rates after a long pause while the stock market was near a high. The market did well afterward, thanks largely to the vaunted mid-1990s glory days when the Fed engineered the pristine soft economic landing alongside a generational boom in technology investment. As a sidebar, Strategas Research points out it's been rather rare for the Fed to be cutting rates when the bank-stock indexes were near a record high, as they are now. Here again, some fruitful investing phases in the early and mid-1990s precedent shine bright. Such history is helpful to know and worth keeping in mind, though the past cycle has confounded plenty of time-tested patterns. The current bull market is the first to have begun while the Fed was still tightening. A couple of years of an inverted Treasury yield curve never led to a recession as it was supposed to. The tape is now a bit stretched, and sometimes a big rally on a day when data confirms the primary bullish thesis can be a short-term culmination of an advance rather than the start of something new. The bond market, conspicuously, priced in the dovish pileup of data first, the 10-year sliding to just above 4% by Tuesday, and yields retraced a bit higher by week's end. While the idea that a rate cut next week could be a ""sell-the-news"" event became a suddenly popular call late this week, it's plausible given that the value of a rate cut for stocks right here is arguably as something to anticipate as an excuse to add risk, rather than celebrate for its tangible benefits after the fact. Bespoke notes the S & P 500 , after this week's 1.6% climb, registered as ""extreme overbought,"" two standard deviations above its 50-day moving average, for the first time since December. The market, perhaps counterintuitively, tends to do better than average following such readings when they come in a broader uptrend, proof that market trends are persistent. Still, that December instance led to two months of minimal upside progress before the first-quarter momentum unwind and tariff sell-off took hold. The monstrous rally in Oracle shares this week after its transformative multiyear revenue guidance tied to AI data-center services recharged an AI theme that was having one of its periodic gut checks. Nvidia shares looked fatigued and many questions surfaced about the whether the infrastructure buildout would grow redundant and increasingly dependent on debt financing. It's one of those times when the rally has proven sturdy enough to deserve the benefit of the doubt while an open-minded market participant will acknowledge that prices, valuations and attitudes have ascended to heights that leave less room for error and more for potential disappointment. The 6,600 level on the S & P 500, which was touched intraday on Friday almost on the nose before the index sagged to finish at 6584, has been a longstanding upside target by for some perspicacious technical market handicappers since late last year, including strategists Craig Johnson of Piper Sandler and John Kolovos of Macro Risk Advisors. Kolovos leaves open the prospect that the index can get to 7,000 by early next year, though near-term he flags a recent drop in the price correlation among the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks to historic lows as ""a sentiment indicator suggesting complacency."" This is a localized metric, not proof of broad-scale reckless. Low correlation speaks to a lack of concern about market-wide risks. Speaking of the Magnificent Seven, this group still trades at a healthy valuation premium to the rest of the market, though this margin has narrowed, largely as the broader field has grown more expensive. Granting that valuation itself has little predictive potency over a one-year horizon, there's no denying that equities are pretty rich here, with the ""other 493"" S & P 500 components now at 20-times year-ahead earnings. The persistence of earnings growth, quality of business models, strength of balance sheets and reduced tax and regulatory burden on companies might be fair explanations for such valuations — but none of that makes them bargains. The market finds itself at an interesting juncture, with investors suddenly feeling pretty certain about the macro picture and the implications of the Fed's path from here, and with the bull-market muscle-flexing just beginning in the form of meme-stock revivals, hype-propelled IPOs and splashy M & A deals. Elaine Garzarelli of Garzarelli Capital — yes, the famous strategist known for having called the 1987 crash and subsequent market turns in the 1990s — suggests in her weekly market piece that the S & P 500 can hold its high valuation and continue to make progress along with earnings growth, in part because animal spirits are just now revving up: ""Like before, stocks should respond favorably to a possible rising persistent trend of improving confidence into irrational exuberance territory as IPOs, small caps, and other laggards begin to excel. So, even though the S & P 500 is a bit overvalued, irrational exuberance is not yet here."" Of course, we may not be promised an exuberance phase this time around, but one surely cannot be ruled out, after investors this year have progressed through a ""Sell America"" panic, a ""better-than-feared"" rebound and a couple of months of cautious optimism, leading them to exactly the setup the bulls have told themselves they wanted.

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/13/tsla-mu-are-overbought-and-could-be-due-for-a-pullback.html,Tesla and Micron are overbought and could be due for a pullback with stock market at all-time high,"The stock market's run to fresh all-time highs this week has left some individual names in overbought territory, putting them at risk of a pullback. The S & P 500 reached a record of 6,600.21 after an uptick in unemployment claims and a surprise decline in wholesale prices solidified expectations for at least a quarter percentage point rate reduction from the Federal Reserve next week. The benchmark ended the week with a 1.6% gain. Certain stocks, however, may have run too far too fast. Using the CNBC Pro screening tool , we searched for S & P 500 stocks that jumped more than 5% whose relative strength index climbed to 70 or above. An RSI above 70 signals an asset may be overbought — suggesting it may be susceptible to a downdraft. Here are the top 10 most overbought stocks on the Street: Tesla and Micron Technology made the overbought list, with RSIs of 75.6 and 81.2, respectively. The electric vehicle maker added to its strong September performance with this week's gains, putting it up about 18% month to date. The stock had been on fire since Tesla's board proposed a nearly $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk . As for Micron, the stock soared about 20% this week for its biggest weekly performance since March 2020. Citi raised its price target on the stock to $175 on Thursday, signaling upside of 11% from Friday's close. ""Micron will report F4Q25 results on September 23 after market close. We expect the company to report in-line results and guide well above consensus driven by higher DRAM and NAND sales and pricing. We believe the continued memory upturn is being driven by limited production and better than expected demand, particularly from the data center end market (55% of Micron revenue),"" analyst Christopher Danely wrote. But given how quickly both stocks have risen, investors may be tempted to book profits, which will put pressure on them. Other overbought names include Warner Bros. Discovery , as Paramount Skydance prepares a takeover bid for the media giant, and Live Nation . Western Digital is the most overbought name on the list with an RSI of 84.2.

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/12/stock-market-next-week-outlook-for-sept-15-19-2025.html,What Fed Chair Powell says next week will be critical for a stock market insistent on cuts,"What Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says about the path of monetary easing next week will be critical to a stock market that's been insistent on interest rate cuts. The Fed meeting next week is a critical one. Investors are certain the central bank will have to cut rates for the first time since December at the conclusion of its Sept. 16-17 meeting, with some even hopeful for a jumbo half-percentage point cut. Not only that, the latest Summary of Economic Projections is also due, giving insight into how policymakers are thinking through monetary policy. Lower rates can turbocharge an already surging stock market. However, risks on the economic front — particularly in the labor market — are becoming more apparent. Those worries are starting to show up elsewhere, such as in the bond market or in the rise in gold. This week, the short end of the yield curve moved higher, while the long end moved lower, a development investors worry could start affecting equities. ""The whole yield curve is shifting down, but the curve is changing shape as well,"" said Mark Malek, investment chief at Siebert Financial. ""It's possible that people really are concerned. Starting to get worried that these employment numbers are the seeds of what could be an economic slowdown."" ""We really do need to continue following that going forward,"" Malek said. ""There's some message in that yield curve. I'm not sure anybody knows what it is yet."" US10Y YTD mountain U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, year to date Meanwhile, the stock market itself continues to climb. On Friday, the major averages were set to close in positive territory for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial average is higher by roughly 1%. The S & P 500, which remains near all-time highs above 6,500, advanced 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 2% this week. 'Hallmarks of anxiety' Many investors remain confident that artificial intelligence will continue to back the equity market's advance, even in the face of an economic slowdown. It's how long it can that is the question. Theoretically, there could be a ""crossover"" point, said Siebert Financial's Malek, when weakness in the economy will stall enthusiasm for the AI buildout. But, few investors expect that that is anytime soon. ""I don't know that I've witnessed something that I perceive to be as much of a growth or expansion opportunity like [AI]. We've seen similar things. But this is really sustainable, ... and nothing is really throwing us,"" Malek said. ""Even in an economic slowdown, one can still make a case for owning these stocks, certainly long term."" ""I suspect that nothing lasts forever in the market. There will be a day where either they will just on their own lose that escape velocity that they need, or they'll be overtaken by the economy,"" Malek continued. ""I don't know what that point is yet. It's not here, for sure, at this point."" Certainly, there's cause for concern for the economic outlook. This week's consumer price index showed an in-line reading in the year-over-year figure, which soothed investors. But, a peek under the hood showed pricing pressures have exacerbated across a number of goods. Apparel prices rose, as did motor vehicle parts. Groceries posted their biggest increase since August 2022. That hardly bodes well for the market. This week, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury dipped to 4.0% , after higher jobless claims on Thursday became the latest in a raft of recent data confirming the labor market is in a downturn. Gold prices are hovering near an all-time high , above $3,600, continuing to rally even after a three-year bull run. All of those crosscurrents are items that investors are starting to earmark. ""The typical hallmarks of anxiety are all there, in the market,"" Malek said. Week ahead calendar All times ET.

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/sell-in-may-dont-get-taken-in-by-seasonal-trading-patterns.html,Sell in May? Don't get taken in by seasonal trading patterns,"It's a tough time if you believe in following historical seasonal indicators for the stock market. Since 1950, April is the second best month for the S & P 500 (up an average 1.5%), and the best month for the Dow Industrials (up an average 1.8%), according to the Stock Trader's Almanac . That hasn't happened this year. With one day left in the month, the S & P 500 is down about 1% in April, the Dow Industrials off by 3.5%. Other seasonal barometers have not been particularly bullish. January was up, an historically optimistic sign, but February and March were down months, as was the first quarter. And one of the most popular seasonal indicators -- the Best Six Months, which runs from November through the end of April — is also negative. The S & P 500 is 2.5% below its close at the end of October of last year. What gives? And should you trade on seasonal indicators? Best six months wraps up It really is rather startling when you look at the returns. There is a lot of noise and randomness in stock trading patterns, and it is often very difficult to find a signal in the noise. But there is a noticeable, roughly 6% difference in the average yearly returns between investing in the Dow Industrials from November through April vs. May through October. Best/worst six months for Dow Industrials (1950-present) November 1-April 30: up 7.4% May 1-Oct. 31: up 0.8% Source: Stock Trader's Almanac Using the same timeline for the S & P 500, Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick notes November-April are the strongest six months for that benchmark too. Best/worst six months for S & P 500 (1950-present) November 1-April 30: up 7.1% May 1-Oct. 31: up 1.8% Source: Ryan Detrick, Carson Group What accounts for the Best Six Months effect? Why does this happen? Why does the market tend to be higher from November through April? Here's an interesting hint: it's not just in the U.S. The pattern is global. One academic study found that th e pattern was true in 36 of the 37 developed and emerging markets studied, and was particularly strong in Europe. But why? The same authors examined several possible explanations, but concluded ""none of these appears to explain the puzzle convincingly."" Another study thought it was a product of an ""optimism cycle,"" where investors simply look ahead at the end of the year to the new year with overly optimistic expectations, but that optimism becomes hard to sustain as the new year progresses. A more intriguing explanation comes from a study that looked at the effect of shorter days on investor behavior. In ""Winter Blues: A Sad Stock Market Cycle,"" several academics proposed that this phenomenon was due to the role of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). What does SAD have to do with stock returns? The authors contend that stock returns are related to the amount of daylight and that shorter days cause many to become more risk averse. This risk aversion causes investors to do less, which (by implication) leads to less speculative trading and fewer chances to make mistakes. When the Best Six Months breaks down Given what looks like a strong seasonal pattern, what happens when the Best Six Month pattern breaks down, as it has this year (both the Dow and the S & P are down in the November-April period). Stock market historians noted that in periods when the Best Six Months have been negative, the market has usually struggled. ""When the market does not rally during the bullish season other forces are more powerful and when that season ends those forces may really have their say,"" Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac, said in a recent note to subscribers. Hirsch noted that there have been 16 years since 1950 where the Dow Industrials have been negative in the November-April period (most recently in 2020 and 2022), and that bear markets had ensued or continued in 14 of those 16 years. ""Only in 2009 and 2020 were the bear markets already over,"" Hirsch said. Should anyone trade on seasonals? Whatever the reason, and whatever the historical pattern, the main issue is, should anyone trade on this? The answer is likely no. One reason is the whole catchphrase, ""Sell in May, and Go Away"" may be a bit overrated. Detrick points out that May has been up in nine of the past 10 years. Maybe we should switch to ""sell in June?"" The June to November six-month period has also produced sub-par 2.7% returns since 1950, Detrick notes. The lesson here: go ahead and knock yourself out if you want to trade seasonal patterns, but you're probably not going to outperform in the long run. After 35 years of covering markets, here's what I believe: buy and hold beats market timing of any kind. Have a plan, understand how much risk you can afford to take and still be able to sleep at night, and stick to the plan. One simple reason I am not a proponent of market timing of any kind is that the biggest gains in the market occur on only a handful of days each year, and no one knows on which days they will occur. In my book, "" Shut Up and Keep Talking: Lessons on Life and Investing From the Floor of the New York Stock Exchange ,"" I show a simple study by Dimensional Funds that charts the growth of $1,000 invested in the S & P 500 in 1970 through 2019. Hypothetical growth of $1,000 invested in the S & P 500 in 1970 (through August 2019) Total return $138,908 Minus the best 5 days $90,171 Minus the best 15 days $52,246 Minus the best 25 days $32,763 Source: Dimensional Funds These are startling numbers. Taking out the best five days in those 50 years, and your return would be 35% lower, and even less if you were not in the market on the best 15 and 25 days. And remember: you have no idea when those best days will come. If that reasoning doesn't impress you, ask yourself this: what would you do with the money if you pulled it out at the end of April? Put it in Treasury bills? That would be a losing proposition, Larry Swedroe, former head of financial and economic research at Buckingham Strategic Wealth, tells me. Swedroe agrees that the S & P's returns were inferior in the May through October period but that even those inferior returns outperformed Treasury bills on average. The bottom line, Swedroe says: investors are ""clearly better off staying invested without even considering taxes.""",
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/recent-chaos-shows-investors-are-better-off-avoiding-market-timing.html,Recent chaos shows investors are better off sticking to a plan and avoiding market timing,"The S & P 500 went from 5,670 at the closing high on April 2 to a low of 4,982 at the closing low on April 8, a drop of about 12%. Stocks have since regained a large chunk of that loss. Very large parts of the market have staged a nice bounce back, and some are not far from where they were just prior to when retaliatory tariffs were announced early this month. What's the takeaway for investors? This is a stellar example of why it is a very bad idea to try to trade during market chaos. Investors are better off sticking to a plan and avoid timing markets. Anyone who tried to sell stocks during the downturn in hopes of then trying to buy them back has likely suffered losses. Downturns are a necessary part of investing Everyone knows that over long periods of time, stocks provide a higher return than investing in bonds. Why? Because investing in stocks is riskier than investing in bonds. Investors therefore demand a higher rate of return (known as the risk premium) to invest in stocks than in bonds. And they get a higher rate of return. Larry Swedroe, former head of financial and economic research at Buckingham Strategic Wealth, notes that from 1926 through 2024, U.S. equities returned 10.2% per year on average, while one-month Treasury bills returned only 3.3%. The S & P 500 has risen in three out of every four years for the past 100 years. But that higher return comes with much more volatility. My friend Ben Carlson, who writes a terrific investing blog, A Wealth of Common Sense , points out that on average, stocks fall by 5% roughly two to three times per year, 10% roughly every year or two, and 20% or more roughly once every 4 to 5 years. Declines of 20% or more are fairly rare, but they do happen. The peak to trough decline this month is roughly 12% on a closing basis, but we approached a decline of almost 19% from the market peak in February (6,144 on February 19) to the low in April. That is very close to the common shorthand definition of a bear market (a decline of 20% or more). The price for higher returns Those kinds of declines are part of the price we pay for higher returns. ""Thus, if investors want stocks to provide high expected returns, bear markets (while painful to endure) should be considered a necessary evil,"" Swedroe writes in a recent Substack article. That is where mental discipline really comes in. Investors need to fight the urge to do something when there is market chaos. ""The first key to successful investing is to have a well-thought-out plan that includes an understanding of the nature of the risks of investing,"" Swedroe says. Sticking with that plan requires real mental discipline. Studies indicate that investors underperform their benchmarks because excess trading reduces their returns. ""In bull markets, greed and envy take over, and risk is overlooked. In bear markets, fear and panic take over, and even well-thought-out plans can end up in the trash heap of emotions,"" Swedroe says. One rule of successful investing is not taking on more risk than you are comfortable with. If the prospect of a 20% decline in the markets leaves you sleepless, you either need to realize it is a long-term game and not worry about the short-term losses, or lighten up on your exposure. Another key to successful investing: disabuse yourself of the notion that you can trade your way out of a chaotic market. ""Trying to time the market is a loser's game — one that is possible to win but not prudent to try because the odds of doing so are so poor,"" Swedroe says. ""Those who avoid excessive risk-taking are the ones most likely to stay the course and avoid the buy high/sell low pattern that bedevils most investors,"" he added. Swedroe urges investors to stick to long-term investing in low-cost index funds. ""Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies."" Most importantly, when you look at your quarterly statement and see you are down on the year, understand that this is a part of investing.

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/14/tariff-volatility-is-making-it-hard-for-investors-to-figure-out-where-the-sp-500-should-trade.html,Tariff volatility is making it hard for investors to figure out where the S&P 500 should trade right now,"It was another weekend of head-spinning news, but we are no closer to figuring out what the right level should be for stocks. The good news is that while President Donald Trump has a higher pain threshold than most thought, there is a pain threshold, and the tariff exemption on the electronics industry means that a tech earnings collapse is far less likely. The bad news is that trade policy is now completely dependent on day-to-day negotiations and mood swings, which makes it very difficult to argue for any kind of serious rally, and stagflation worries are not going away. Low visibility into 2025 earnings As for earnings, there is no consensus on the two most important determinants of stock prices: The actual dollar level of earnings growth for 2025, and what the correct multiple should be, which is how much an investor would be willing to pay for that future stream of earnings. The dollar level of earnings growth for 2025 is now $267 or up roughly 10%, but there is little confidence in that projection. Depending on whom you ask, it could be somewhere between that level and $242, which is no growth at all in earnings, or could be as much as down 20%, which would be a recessionary decline for earnings. S & P 500 2025: What's the right earnings level? $267: up 10% (current consensus) $242: up 0% $193: down 20% (recessionary decline) Source: LSEG A decline of 20% in earnings may seem extreme, and while it is unusual, it is not unprecedented. There have been four occasions in the past 25 years where the earnings for the year were 20% below the estimate at the start of the year: 2001, 2008, 20098, and 2020, according to FactSet. It's the same problem with the multiple. The current multiple of 19 for 2025 earnings has come down from 21 a month or so ago, but multiples above 17 are typically given when the economy is expanding, and that is not happening. So what's the right multiple? Depending on whom you ask, it could be anywhere from 17, which is an historic average multiple, to 14, which is a recessionary multiple. S & P 500 2025: What's the right multiple? 19: current multiple 17: historic average 14: recessionary multiple Source: LSEG Mix and match the actual dollar earnings estimate with the multiple, and you can get an enormous variation in where the S & P 500 should be. Are you an optimist or a pessimist? On an optimistic scenario, you could assume the majority of the tariffs go away, the status quo prevails and the U.S. avoids a recession, at which point perhaps earnings up 10% and a multiple of 19 (the current consensus) could work. A more ""realistic"" but still optimistic scenario would be that tariffs of some sort are still in place, earnings rise only 5% (half what is expected), and the multiple will contract to 18 from 19. This brings you to 4,572, still roughly 800 points below the current level. The right price for the S & P 500: Optimistic scenario Current: earnings up 10%, multiple 19: 5,363 Earnings: up 5% ($254), multiple 18: 4,572 It's easy to get even more pessimistic from here. Assume zero earnings growth ($242) with an historic average multiple of 17 and you get 4,114, about 23% below Friday's close. If earnings drop 10% ($218) you are at 3,706. If they fall 20%, you are in the 3,200 range. The right price for the S & P 500: pessimistic scenario Current: earnings up 10%, multiple 19: 5,363 Earnings up 0%, multiple 17: 4,114 Earnings down 10%, multiple 17: 3,706 Earnings down 20%, multiple 17: 3,281 This is why the market is gyrating daily. This is why you get these kind of daily price swings in the past seven days: Friday: up 1.8% Thursday: down 3.5% Wednesday: up 9.5% Tuesday: down 1.6% Monday: down 0.2% Friday: down 6.0% Thursday: down 4.8% No one can figure out the right level.",
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/08/how-20percent-declines-in-stocks-came-to-be-known-as-bear-markets-on-wall-street.html,How 20% declines in stocks came to be known as 'bear markets' on Wall Street,"The S & P 500 is inches away from a decline of 20% from its recent closing high on February 19. This, we are told, would constitute a ""bear market."" But who decided that a drop of 20% was a ""bear market?"" For that matter, who decided a drop of 10% was a ""correction?"" If you think a committee of sage Wall Street veterans got together to vote on it, you'd be mistaken. The whole idea of labeling a decline of 10% to 20% a ""correction"" and 20% or more a ""bear market"" was largely the work of one man. Alan Shaw was one of the legendary founders of technical analysis. He was co-founder of the Market Technicians Association (now the Chartered Market Technician Association) and was managing director of the technical research department at Smith Barney. Magnitude of decline He retired in 2000, but long before that he had developed a simple method for describing the magnitude of market declines. ""Alan tried to make it simple and easy,"" Louise Yamada told me. She would know: Yamada started working with Alan in 1980. By then, she said, he had already established his basic framework. ""He would say anything up to 10% was a consolidation, 10% to 20% was a correction, and more than 20% was considered a bear market,"" she told me. After Alan retired in 2000, Louise took up the technical analysis reins at Smith Barney until 2005, when she, too, left and set up her own firm. Louise noted that other technicians have their own definition of what constitutes a bear market, but that the ""correction"" and ""bear market"" terms that Alan created for 10%-20% and 20% or more declines struck a chord in the public imagination. ""It's just so easy and simple to remember,"" she said. Measuring the start of a bear market One point everyone agrees on: determining a 20% decline is based on closing prices, not intraday. Based on this, S & P Dow Jones Indices noted that the historic closing high for the S & P 500 was February 19 when it ended the day at 6,144.15. To get to a 20% decline, the S & P 500 would have to close at 4,915.32. One other point: closing at or below 4,915.32 is not the start of the bear market. The start of the bear market would date from the day of the market high, February 19. ""A bear market starts with the 1st downtick after the final price high,"" Tom McClellan, editor of The McClellan Market Report, told me. ""It does not start once you reach 20%. The entirety of the decline is 'bear market territory.'"" This is a point that S & P Dow Jones Indices also emphasized: ""If the index closes at 4,915.32 (-3.13% for the day) or lower today, we will classify 2/19/2025 as the ending date of the Bull market (6,144.15) and starting date of the Bear,"" the firm said in a note to clients on Monday. The path ahead ""If you say we are down 20%, it doesn't do you any good, it doesn't tell you what will happen next,"" McClellan told me. His advice: ""Go with the trend, unless you have a compelling reason to go against the trend."" What is the trend? ""We have been in a downtrend, but we are so oversold it is unlikely to continue, so the probability of a bounce is very high."" Then what? ""Then you have to evaluate the quality of the bounce,"" McLellan said. Alan Shaw passed away several years ago, but Louise Yamada is still teaching her classes on technical analysis, and says we may not be at a bottom. ""What we are all looking for here is for a Bear Market Rally which Alan defined as a rally of 10% or more that follows a market decline of 20% or more,"" Yamada noted, ""after which the market declines to a new low."" That's when, ""THE BEAR CLAW COMES OUT again."" Ever the market historian, Yamada noted the average bear market rally for the S & P 500 from 1929 thru 2020 is 18% over 31 trading days.",

The S & P 500 closed Friday with a market capitalization of $42.99 trillion, a two-day loss of $5.06 trillion or 10.5% compared to its market capitalization Wednesday night, when President Trump raised U.S. tariffs on imported goods. A more useful comparison is to compare the decline since the market hit its all-time high in mid-February. The S & P 500 large-cap stock index touched its record high the week of February 19, valued at $52.05 trillion. Since then, market capitalization has declined 17.4%, which corresponds with the price decline in the S & P.

You can see this if you look at global stock market capitalization excluding the U.S. Global stock market capitalization, ex-U.S. 2/19: $34.1 trillion 4/4/25: $32.05 trillion Loss: $2.06 trillion (6%) Source: S & P Dow Jones Indices The decline in the global markets ex-U.S. is only 6%, versus an 18.1% decline in the U.S. broad market. Bottom line: the U.S. led the way up in the global rally, and is now leading the way down. It remains to be seen whether global markets will follow through to catch up with the U.S. decline.",

""The next target is the company's early 2022 all-time high of $186 and change, within sight, up less than ten bucks from here. After that? I say it could go through $200.""Johnson & Johnson's stock has been weighed down for years bylawsuitsrelated to its talc products — so Cramer suggested it might be a surprise to some that the company has been able to ""defy the gravitational pull of this health care bear market."" Shares are currently up more than 23% year-to-date.While Cramer said Johnson & Johnson's legal issues aren't resolved, he suggested Wall Street is starting to look past them in part because of a recent change to its legal strategy, as well as the strength of its pharma business. The drug maker is no longer seeking sweeping bankruptcy settlements, and it is insteadfighting the lawsuitsin court. To Cramer, there now seems to be a feeling that ""the plaintiff's lawyers pursuing these cases have overplayed their hand.""Although market has largely soured on big pharmaceutical names, Cramer pointed out that Johnson & Johnson is not purely a pharmaceutical company. It has a fairly large medical device arm that supplements the core drug business, he continued. The company's medical device business is a source of steady growth, Cramer said, especially its cardiovascular category. He also pointed to Johnson & Johnson's technology in other areas like robotic surgery and neurovascular care.Cramer said he likes the company's drug portfolio as well, saying it's been strong since Johnson & Johnson spun off its over-the-counter business two years ago. But the pharma giant is facing a patent cliff with one of its key drugs, Stelara, which is used to treat autoimmune conditions, Cramer conceded. However, Johnson & Johnson has a number of other treatments boosting sales, especially drugs to treat certain cancers.""Frankly, there's more to the pharma strength than I have time to get to, because the drug business here is so enormous,"" he said. ""In total, J&J has thirteen drugs with double-digit growth rates, and overall, the rest of the drug portfolio's growing up so well that…the loss of exclusivity for Stelara — afterthought.""""Our results reflect the depth and strength of our uniquely diversified business,"" a spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson told CNBC. ""We expect elevated growth in the second half of the year and have a lot to look forward to over the next six months with game-changing approvals, such as the recent FDA approval of INLEXZO in bladder cancer and submissions anticipated in areas like lung cancer, major depressive disorder, psoriasis, surgery and cardiovascular.""watch nowVIDEO7:1707:17After a couple years in purgatory, Johnson & Johnson is now having a strong year, says Jim CramerMad Money with Jim CramerJim Cramer's Guide to InvestingClick here to downloadJim Cramer's Guide to Investingat no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.Sign up nowfor the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.DisclaimerQuestions for Cramer?Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

He was the second premier in a year to fall over the government’s attempts to repair France’s public finances.Fitch said the vote “illustrates the increased fragmentation and polarisation of domestic politics”, adding that instability made reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2029, as targeted by Bayrou’s government, “unlikely”.Macron has namedSébastien Lecornu, another ally, to replace Bayrou. With no parliamentary majority, he faces the same political challenges in getting a budget through a divided parliament.He is expected to push for a compromise with leftwing lawmakers over a new budget proposal, but any deal would require less ambitious deficit reduction targets.France far overshot its deficit targets last year after making inaccurate forecasts on tax revenue, taking the deficit to 5.8 per cent in 2024, far above EU limits of 3 per cent. The government forecasts the deficit to fall to 5.4 per cent by the end of 2025.However, Fitch projected the deficit to remain above 5 per cent in 2026-27, adding that there was a “high likelihood that the political deadlock continues beyond the [2027 presidential] election”.France’s political malaise has sent its borrowing costs close to their highest since the Eurozone debt crisis more than a decade ago. The benchmark 10-year yield rose above 3.6 per cent in the days running up to Bayrou’s resignation, since coming back a little to 3.49 per cent.The spread over benchmark German Bunds — a measure of investor anxiety watched closely by economists and politicians — is around 0.8 percentage points, significantly above its usual post-crisis level as French borrowing costs close in on those of Italy, a longtime focus of Eurozone debt concerns.Éric Dor, an economist at IÉSEG business school, said the rating downgrade “confirms the reality of the problem of French public finances but the markets have preceded the rating agencies”.He added: “We’re not trading like an AA- country. It shows the importance to finally find consensus to stabilise public debt.”The deficit problems in part stem from heavy spending to support businesses and households during the Covid-19 pandemic and the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Macron’s tax reductions on businesses, property owners and the wealthy have also reduced the public tax intake, while the expected boost to growth has not been as large as expected.Fitch also noted that France has long struggled to reduce overall social spending, which stands at 32 per cent of GDP compared with an EU average of 26 per cent.RecommendedSovereign bondsFrance joins Eurozone’s ‘periphery’ as turmoil deepens, say investorsThe country is already in an excessive debt procedure by the European Commission, part of Brussels’ fiscal rules to keep public finances under control and prevent member states’ annual budget deficit from surpassing 3 per cent of GDP.The prospect of higher defence spending also places pressure on France’s public finances. Macron has committed to boosting France’s defence budget by €6.5bn over two years, in response to US President Donald Trump’s calls for Nato members to increase their military expenditure.Nevertheless, Fitch pointed to France’s “large, diversified high-income economy”, its Eurozone membership and sound banking sector as some reasons for optimism.France’s outgoing finance minister Éric Lombard saidLecornuhas “already begun consulting the political forces in parliament, with a view to adopting a national budget and continuing efforts to rebuild our public finances”.",2025-09-12T17:45:52.384000

However, sophisticated financial institutions and trading firms known as “approved participants” can also create or redeem shares in them. This is the mechanism that helps them trade in line with the value of their underlying holdings.Rather than reflecting a rise in the value of its holdings, ARK’s ballooning size has been driven by a surge of share creations this week, with the ETF’s shares outstanding rising more than 33mn up until the end of Thursday, according to Bloomberg data.Traders said the moves appear to be tied to the long-awaited IPO ofKlarnaon Wednesday, with one or several investors jumping into the ARK ETF on the hopes of securing some of the resulting windfall before likely exiting again in the coming days. The payments company’s shares rose almost15 per centon their debut.“This ETF trade is one of the sharpest, bare-knuckled trades I’ve seen,” said Victor Haghani, the founder and chief investment officer of Elm Wealth, which sponsors the Elm Market Navigator ETF. “Non-professional active investors should be in no doubt about the smarts and sophistication of who is likely doing the other side of their trade.”ARK Invest did not immediately respond to a request for comment.This mimics a similarphenomenonaround the IPO of Bullish in mid-August, when the ARK Innovation ETF — known by its ticker ARKK — suddenly inflated by $5bn. After the shares of the crypto exchange soared 83 per cent on the first day of trading, the shares in ARKK were redeemed and the money left the fund.However, the trade around Klarna’s IPO would not have been assuccessfulas the one pegged to the Bullish listing, in which ARK Invest secured a large allocation.Filingsindicate the ARK Innovation ETF did not invest in Klarna’s IPO, despite ARK previously touting the payments company in its marketing materials as a business that was “transforming shopping”, and its heavy backing for other hot listings in recent months such as Circle and Figma.The trader or traders that secured tens of millions of shares in ARK Innovation ETF over the past week are thus unlikely to have made a quick profit.However the fund’s sister ETF — the smaller ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) — acquired an allocation of just less than 492,000 Klarna shares, worth roughly $20mn, and had a similar trading pattern.ARKF’s assets almost doubled as investors pumped $683mn into the fund across Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. But as of the end of Thursday, ARKF’s assets had fallen back to $1.34bn — down from more than $2bn at the time of Klarna’s flotation.Klarna’s shares have since retreated to trade at just over the initial IPO price of $40, limiting any gains the ARKF trade might have generated.",2025-09-12T15:44:38.226000

The listing could value the company at more than $50bn and raise between $4bn-$5bn.Medline’s board is set to meet next week to make a final decision about whether to push forward with an IPO in the remaining months of 2025 or pursue the offering in early 2026, said the people. Blackstone, Hellman & Friedman and Carlyle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The listing will be closely watched by investors, as Medline delayed prior IPO plans earlier this year over concerns about tariff impacts. Many of Medline’s medical products are sourced or manufactured in China and other tariff-affected countries, including Vietnam, Japan and Mexico.After years of postponements because of high interest rates and lower valuations, private capital groups have endured additional delay due to uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Medline was the largest among a handful of prominent companies thatdelayed their IPOsafter his “liberation day”.The offering will also be a closely followed deal for the $4tnprivate equityindustry, which will signal whether large private equity groups can begin exiting their largest takeover deals through IPOs. The trio of private equity investors took over Medline, a family-run, Chicago-based company, for $34bn in 2021 in one of the largest leveraged buyouts of all time.Medline has benefited from a jump in its profits since the takeover, according to Fitch, which upgraded its credit rating in January. The group’s private equity owners have been waiting to realise billions of dollars in paper gains, as a multiyear downturn in new listing activity is beginning to reverse.RecommendedLexIPOsUS IPO hopefuls: once more, with feelingPremiumcontentMedline’s plans emerged at the end of a week in which seven large-cap companies, including buy now, pay later firm Klarna, the Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange Gemini and Blackstone-backed data centre engineer Legence went public in the US.There were no guarantees that Medline would decide to go public this year, the people stressed, adding that the IPO could lapse into next year if there is further market uncertainty. The group’s owners, which also include sovereign wealth funds in Singapore and Abu Dhabi and its founding family, have not set firm goals on the size or valuation of the offering, meaning figures could change, the people added.Medline first confidentially filed IPO plans at the end of last year, to list in 2025. Medline’s updated S1 filing included figures from the second quarter in which it generated $935mn in adjusted earnings, two people said. The business was on track to generate roughly $3.8bn in earnings across 2025, they added.",2025-09-13T05:00:08.638000
https://www.ft.com/content/b972f0f7-8f13-4e18-9991-8e22fa118625,Labubu has nothing to fear from Wakuku or Lafufu,"PublishedSeptember 13 2025Jump to comments sectionPrint this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.The global mania for Labubu dolls has given parent company Pop Mart a huge boost. The Hong Kong-listed stock has shot up 470 per cent over the past 12 months. With a market cap of HK$367bn ($47bn), Pop Mart is now worth more than Mattel, Hasbro and Japan’s Sanrio combined.The profitability of the toothy elflike creature and Pop Mart’s “blind box” business model has given rise to a host of would-be competitors, such as Wakukus — launched by Chinese retailer Miniso — and Lafufus, as the fake Labubus flooding the market are called. Fears that they could take a bite out of Pop Mart’s colossal success, however, look misplaced.Miniso looks like the chief challenger. The launch of Wakuku dolls drew long lines at its flagship stores across China, and the group has a far bigger physical presence than Pop Mart itself, with 7,900 retail stores worldwide against Pop Mart’s 443 stores and 2,437 vending machines. While Miniso is best known for selling budget-friendly knick-knacks such as home goods, toys, snacks and fashion accessories, it has form in selling products licensed from brands such as Disney and Marvel.Yet the $42bn-a-year global collectable toy market is vast and can accommodate both Labubus and the nascent Wakuku. And striking viral toy gold is easier said than done. Pop Mart’s doll only became the fashion accessory du jour after K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink posted about her collection to her 100mn followers on social media.Rather than Wakuku sales, a better indication of longer-term demand for Labubu may be the resale market. What started as a $22 toy was regularly being flipped for three or four times that. Speculative buying appears to be cooling, with anecdotal evidence suggesting resale prices are falling. But a healthier secondary market may actually make it easier for Pop Mart to expand Labubu’s fan base.Pop Mart has made a mint from its success. A gross margin of 67 per cent last year puts it on a par with luxury groups such as LVMH, rather than traditional toy companies. At 26 times forward earnings, too, the group now trades at a premium to the luxury behemoth.Trouble is, viral toy crazes have less durable appeal than buttery-soft handbags. This means that Pop Mart has to keep releasing new products to keep its star brand relevant, while also developing its next superstar. The risk for Pop Mart is not that consumers will prefer a different toothy doll. It is that they will eventually lose their taste for them altogether.pan.yuk@ft.com",2025-09-13T00:00:40.237000
https://www.ft.com/content/2ed22367-553d-4ea4-a35b-cedb0a7eddbb,Can buying homes with cryptocurrencies move out of the fringe?,"Lisa FreedmanPublishedSeptember 13 2025Jump to comments sectionPrint this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.The summer is traditionally a quiet time forpropertymoves. But at the end of July, Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California, based in LA, made waves with a new launch: the US’s first dedicated premiumcryptocurrencydivision. With a $1bn portfolio of properties accepting digital currency payments, the brokerage has put together a team of lawyers, analysts and crypto experts to handle transactions in which both the buyer and seller work exclusively with digital payments.The launch followed the US government’s passing of the Genius Act, the country’s first major cryptocurrency legislation. Genius — which stands for Guaranteeing Essential National Infrastructure in US-Stablecoins — is, as its name suggests, intended to establish a regulatory regime for “stablecoins”, a form of cryptocurrency backed by reliable assets, such as the dollar. The act reflects Trump’s own conversion to an asset class he once viewed as “a scam”, but it’s also an indicator that cryptocurrencies are being used by some as a means of purchasing everything from McDonald’s to mansions. And in terms of the US property market, it is pushing at a door that other countries have helped to unlock.“America entering the conversation [in this way] does lend weight,” says lawyer Laura Birrell, chief executive and co-founder of Parallel, the first company in the Cayman Islands to facilitate cryptocurrency real-estate transactions. The act, she says, is helping the idea of buying homes with cryptocurrency to “move out of the fringe”.Aaron Kirman, chief executive of the Christie’s subsidiary, decided to open the division after completing several large cryptocurrency sales. “I had a client call me and ask, then a second. In about 2022, I realised there was [increasing] demand. Now, we’re not just accepting crypto, we’re creating a new marketplace.” A $2.2mn mid-century home in Pasadena and a $63mn five-bedroom mansion on Nightingale Drive in West Hollywood with views to the Pacific are a sample of what he has to offer.The Invisible House, in Joshua Tree, California, $17.95mn through Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California, can be bought with cryptocurrency© One Shot ProductionsThe new division has a two-tiered appeal for buyers, he says: on one level to “a growing class of digital asset holders looking to diversify into premier real estate” and on the other to those wealthy (and often famous) clients seeking the utmost discretion. Kirman believes that purchasing with cryptocurrency can potentially provide them with a greater degree of privacy than the limited liability companies (LLC) that are the traditional means of maximising anonymity. For sellers, the advantage is that it potentially broadens the pool of available buyers, particularly at the top end of the market.But it’s not just the rich and famous who could stand to benefit from the Genius Act. According to a recent Gallup poll, about 14 per cent of American adults now hold at least some cryptocurrency, and in June, the US government-sponsored mortgage providers Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) were instructed to consider crypto investments as part of homebuyers’ portfolios when applying for mortgages.The UK property market has largely been resistant to crypto — Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, remains a naysayer. Others are wary of a means of payment that is often linked with extreme risk takers and the nefarious.It appeals to those wealthy (and often famous) clients seeking the utmost discretion“It’s an interesting, innovative area, but until regulatory frameworks catch up, buying property with crypto remains a legal and financial grey area,” says Liam Bailey, partner and global head of research at Knight Frank. First, there is compliance. “Most legal systems and banks require source-of-funds verification; this is more challenging with anonymous or semi-anonymous crypto holdings. Also to some extent the infrastructure to support crypto-to-property deals — escrow, legal contracts, lender support — is still in its infancy.” He adds: “There is also an issue with volatility —rapid price swings in cryptocan make it difficult to lock in property values or structure deals with confidence.”But a handful of countries, particularly those keen to attract the wealthy, are increasingly providing a welcoming environment for homebuyers using crypto as means of payment.While it is still early days for cryptocurrency property purchase, broader proposals on how it should be used and regulated are paving the way for more widespread adoption. In December last year, for example, the EU finalised MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation), which sets out clear guidelines regulating stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies.EU officials are also accelerating plans for a digital euroin the wake of the US stablecoin law.The UK’s approach is evolving; last month the Financial Conduct Authority lifted the ban on offering crypto exchange traded products to retail investors.Residential skyscrapers and luxury villas on the waterfront of Palm Jumeirah in Dubai, UAE, a leader in the digital property market© BloombergDubai, one of the world’s most buoyant property markets, has taken the lead in terms of establishing infrastructure to support a move towards increased cryptocurrency use in the sector. In 2017, the Dubai Land Department (DLD) launched a blockchain platform to record real-estate contracts, including leases and registrations. In 2022, Dubai introduced the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), the world’s first regulator for virtual assets, which oversees all digital asset use in the UAE, including real estate. VARA has worked with the DLD to approve frameworks that allow crypto to fiat (government issued currency) exchange through licensed platforms, and signed partnerships to streamline digital transactions to real estate. Later this year the UAE is launching the digital dirham, a digital version of the UAE’s national currency.Victoria Garrett, head of global residential at international real estate agents Savills, feels there are still too few crypto sales taking place to call this a trend, but in terms of Dubai’s practices, sees the use of blockchain as advantageous. “It gives you one single source about a purchase history, which makes transactions run much more smoothly.”The Genius Act reflects Trump’s own conversion to an asset class he once viewed as ‘a scam’Dubai’s regulatory framework and the fact that it has no capital gains or personal income tax on crypto profits earned by individuals are key drivers in the digital property market; a spend of Dh2mn ($544,588/£407,140), or Dh1mn for over 55s, brings the benefits of a golden visa. Off-plan purchases are popular and developers such asDamac and BinGhatti accept direct payment in specified cryptocurrencies, and can make the currency conversion. Once a sale has been agreed, prospective purchasers are sent anti-money laundering and “know your customer” documents to verify their identity and the source of their funds. It is also possible to buy existing property with cryptocurrency, though sellers do not accept cryptocurrency payments directly; a regulated service provider exchanges the currency into dirhams.Engels & Völkers Middle East is currently selling a number of properties in prime locations that accept crypto payments, such as the apartments at Passo by Beyond at Palm Jumeirah (from Dh5.5mn), and a five-bedroom villa at Damac Lagoons at Dh3.725mn. “What has surprised us is that cryptocurrencies are being used not only by people who’ve made their money recently, but by traditional old money — and it’s not just one nationality,” says chief executive Daniel Hadi.In Europe, Switzerland has been at the forefront of adopting cryptocurrencies,introducing laws around the trading, custody of assets and classification. Since 2021, the canton of Zug has accepted bitcoin and ether as a means of paying tax and, currently, theSwiss stock exchange is exploring the creation of a European venue to trade cryptocurrencies.The southern Swiss city of Lugano in the canton of Ticino, however, is really taking the lead with its ‘Plan B’. Launched in 2022, the strategy is intended to make the city the European hub of bitcoin, blockchain and decentralised technologies, encouraging start-ups and further innovation. Here, crypto is integrated into commercial life, with bitcoin, tether and LVGA being used as a means for paying taxes, public services, parking tickets and tuition fees. It is accepted by 150 local retailers and some estate agents.A four-bedroom lakeside home Lugano, Switzerland, €7,361,500 through Engel & Völkers Lugano; the city is taking the lead as a European hub of cryptocurrency©Lugano sits on the picturesque edge of Lake Lugano surrounded by scenic mountains. The largest Italian-speaking city in Switzerland, it is the economic and cultural fulcrum of southern Switzerland, combining Swiss stability with Mediterranean flair. Its enviable lifestyle positives include an extensive array of top-of-the-range property. “Switzerland is not a tax paradise, but it’s better than Europe in general, and we have seen a boom in the luxury market over the past two years,” says Simon Incir, owner and chief executive of Engel & Völkers Ticino, “with an influx of buyers from England, Germany, Norway and Denmark.” Agency research reveals a 20 per cent rise in the price of detached houses in southern Switzerland between the third quarter of 2020 and the same period in 2024.“Property is generally bought in US dollars,” says Incir, who is selling a six-bedroom contemporary villa with panoramic lake views for SFr6.9mn ($8.575mn/£6.45mn). But, he says, for those looking to buy using crypto, “the first step is to set a price using a stablecoin [to limit] fluctuation in price. The seller can then decide to convert [payment] to Swiss francs or can keep the entire amount in crypto once they have opened an account with the notary.”The agency has seen fewer than 10 crypto sales a year, mainly international buyers, but Incir believes that the foundations are there for more transactions of this kind. “Some sellers are open to accepting crypto payments, as they can convert the funds into Swiss francs. Their priority is receiving the full asking price, and the more people who make money in crypto and move to Switzerland, the more common it could become.”In 2020 the Cayman Islands regulated virtual assets with the Virtual Asset (Service Providers) Act© Getty ImagesThe Cayman Islands, the self-governingBritish Overseas Territory in the Caribbean, has also become prominent in the evolving crypto property market. Having been an offshore jurisdiction of choice for many of the world’s largest banks for more than 30 years, in 2020 it became one of the first locations to regulate virtual assets, by passing the Virtual Asset (Service Providers) Act (VASP).Grand Cayman has hit the sweet spot for crypto investors. There has been substantial interest from a range of buyers from fintech and family offices to digital expats from around the worldGregory Surabian, senior managing director of Melkonian Capital ManagementFor property hunters — crypto or otherwise — Grand Cayman and its capital George Town have clear attractions. As well as a relaxed and safe lifestyle, with excellent healthcare, education, and transport connections to the US and Europe, its tax regime is an obvious draw. Residents pay no income or capital gains tax and no annual property taxes; the islands’ golden visa programme offers a direct path to residence for those investing a minimum of $2.4mn in Cayman real estate.The quality of the property is evolving to reflect an increased demand from international buyers, and Mandarin Oriental recently launched new-build residences (from $8mn).“Grand Cayman has hit the sweet spot for crypto investors,” says Gregory Surabian, senior managing director of Melkonian Capital Management, developers of the 42-residence project. “There has been substantial interest from a range of buyers from fintech and family offices to digital expats from around the world.” None, as yet, has bought using crypto, however.Since George Town-based VASP Parallel brokered its first crypto sale in 2022, it has completed six real-estate transactions in crypto totalling almost $35mn. The company claims to use the most secure blockchain technology, escrowing cryptocurrency in a compliant wallet until the legal process is complete.RecommendedPrime propertyAmericans want to move to Europe — but just how easy is it?“We wanted to make it as straightforward as possible,” says co-founder Birrell, a British lawyer and formerly in-house counsel for Bovis in the UK. “And bring it to a different pool of buyer.”Birrell acknowledges that crypto has not always had an unblemished image, but believes the Cayman Islands’ approach is taking it away from “a wild west scenario”. “People want a compliance route and to do things in the right way.”Meanwhile, back in LA, Christie’s crypto subsidiary is yet to make any closings since its July announcements. But, as Birrell acknowledges, it opens the door to “a change in perspective”.Find out about our latest stories first — follow@ft_houseandhomeon Instagram",2025-09-13T00:00:10.542000
