## Inspiration
We were inspired by the overwhelming amount of financial and social media data available today and wanted to create a tool that simplifies sentiment analysis for stocks. Our goal was to help users quickly understand market mood and trending news without needing to parse through multiple sources.

## What It Does
This project visualizes stock market sentiment in a dynamic, interactive dashboard.
Each stock card displays:
- **Price & price change**
- **Mood indicators and sentiment rings**
- **Recent news and social sentiment**

Users can expand cards to view detailed news sentiment breakdowns, social engagement metrics, and recent headlines—turning complex financial data into a visually intuitive experience.

## How We Built It
- **Frontend:** JavaScript for logic and data manipulation
- **Visualization:** Interactive stock cards and conic-gradient mood rings derived from sentiment scores
- **Data:** JSON arrays containing simulated and real metrics (price changes, sentiment scores, news coverage)
- **Styling:** CSS for responsive layouts, color-coded indicators, and smooth expansion animations

## Individual Contributions
- **Coco & Han:** Back-end development – web scraping, LLM integration, data processing (raw data to CSV)
- **Katherine:** Front-end website development and user interface
- **Diana:** Visual design and user experience

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Mapping sentiment scores to intuitive visuals for non-financial users
- Ensuring smooth dynamic expansions and animations across screen sizes
- Perfecting the conic-gradient “mood ring” effect to represent sentiment percentages

## Accomplishments
- Built a fully interactive dashboard that turns complex data into a visually digestible format
- Designed a unique mood ring feature and real-time sentiment breakdowns

## What We Learned
- Combining data visualization with interactivity in a web app
- Translating quantitative sentiment analysis into user-friendly graphics
- Enhancing UX for complex financial datasets

## What's Next
- Integrate comprehensive, real-time stock and social media data from APIs
- Add advanced metrics like volatility tracking and stock correlation analysis
- Implement filtering and sorting features
- Explore predictive analytics and personalized alerts based on sentiment trends
