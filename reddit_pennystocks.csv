Let me explain:
What I maintain is that it's undervalued. BTBT is currently trading at $2.97 per share, with a total market cap of $955M. As you know, it used to specialize in BTC mining, but due to rising electricity prices, it decided to switch to ETH staking (which is POS and not POW like BTC). It currently holds 121,252 ETH for a total value of $569M. It also owns approximately 74% of a recently listed AI/cloud company, WYFI (IPO about a month ago), with a total market cap of $726M.
