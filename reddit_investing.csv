I would like to hear some honest, no-holds-barred feedback from experienced and established traders.

My question is this: Over the course of 10+ years, do basic options strategies - specifically selling covered calls, cash-secured puts, or a wheel strategy - actually outperform growth-centric ETFs (i.e., QQQ)?
