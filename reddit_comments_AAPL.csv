"I just flipped a coin and it's head up, so I think you should buy call"
That's a good heads up.
This is all the confirmation I needed. Calls it is.
"I mean 50/50 is not bad, beat a lot of professional analysts"
This stock's been lagging too behind Mag7 and SPY. You can take that however you want but I'm long Aapl.
"The air might be a big hit, but I thinks it‚Äôs more timing. A lot of people have phones that are 2-3 years old. Add on the Orange color (a lot of people are surface creatures) and it does look different than the 11 design and I think you‚Äôve setup a good hedge for a big upgrade cycle."
"Exactly this, don't mistake my preorder for interest, I just need a new a phone and Chinese phones are banned because they are, ""security risks"""
"I think Apple has subtlely sold a lot of people on the battery improvements. Me being one. I saw the video and I saw my current iphone, and I thought man it‚Äôd be nice to not have to charge my degraded battery 3x per day and the orange looks great."
"Isn't that just an old battery?

Any iphone should be lasting a day, and reports of ios 26 beta are not promising for battery life."
"yes, lots of users carry old batteries so rather get a new phone than a battery swap"
what an interesting move buying a new phone just because of the battery being worn out üôÉ
its $1k every 6-7 years? not bad at all. way better to upgrade to the latest technology and features than keep an old phone and pay for a battery swap
It's how they get you with planned obsolescence. Battery swap used to be cheap and fast. You wouldn't agree to buy a new car when old one's tires needed to be replaced.
they are giving me a good product every 6-7 years for only $1k. its not a scam lol
"Yeah maybe your world is a bit different, I‚Äôm from hungary, iPhones and other apple atuff more epxensive hete compared to the US while salaries are much much lower. Also 6-7 year is a pretty good lifetime for a battery, nice!"
"Why not just pay $100 at an apple store to replace the battery? 

Sure beats $1000 for essentially the same device with 5% improvement."
"From what I heard from tech YouTube reviewers. The IPhone is more niche. They made it a little worse to make it thinner. And it‚Äôs more expensive than the base model.

I think the new base iPhone is gonna be a hit. It‚Äôs a bigger incremental step than in many years with last years pro features being available on the base model. Not to speak about the increase battery time and storage. All that without any increase in price."
I don't go out too often but the Samsung Galaxy Edge doesn't seem that popular. What I see is more people getting fold 7 or ultras. So my bet is that the thin phone trend doesn't chance on.
WTF is so special about this dumbass iPhone? It‚Äôs thinner and has another camera? Honest question but honestly why tf are people getting huge boners over this?
"China especially is ‚Äústatus symbol‚Äù driven with tech, particularly Apple products.  So new form factors go wild over there because others can easily tell you have the latest gadget."
Or whole East Asia
Yeah fair enough!
Because it‚Äôs a new iPhone
Literally nothing. They do this every year when they launch a new or updated phone.
"Their base model 17 is the best value, basically the 16 pro for $300 less and will last 5+ years easily."
"Hey they cut down battery to make it thin, so now you can buy their external battery to pair with it. Just like how they cut headphone jack to sell airpod. Btw it doesn't even have a speaker, just an earpiece on top"
They got rid of the fucking speaker? So you can‚Äôt even take calls on speaker phone? Or listen to a fucking video?
Only apple can do
USB-C to jack converter
Doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs the new new from Apple. That‚Äôs all that matters
"I'm with you man. The fact that Apple is asking Google for help with AI should show how obviously behind this company is. Nearly the entire event announced spec bumps to their products. There's nothing that warrants people to spend the extra cash for this. But hey, maybe this is what it looks like when the market is feeling toppy."
iSheep
"You can put a bump on any surface with a battery and it's an iPhone now. That's the future. If you can't see that, you aren't looking hard enough. Wearables, AR, foldables-- this is going to pop off"
"People saying a 2,000 dollar iPhone is too expensive were saying the same about AirPods when they first came out."
And they were right both times. There is nothing in the phones that justifies that price tag. Pure herd mentality.
The point is people will still buy them. I Personally buy cheap refurbished ones.
AAPL to $300 by the end of the year
"Every iPhone release has a delivery delay, but this time it‚Äôs different ‚Ä¶ 

- iPhone 12: https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-12-delayed-by-a-month-as-apple-reportedly-slashes-production-20

- iPhone 13: https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-just-ordered-the-iphone-13-pro-max-but-theres-a-brutal-delay

- iPhone 14: https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-14-delivery-date 

- iPhone 15: https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-15-pro-delays-heres-the-latest-delivery-dates 

- iPhone 16: https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-16-pro-delays"
The iPhone delay is basically the new Club 69 faux line at the front door.
I saw the news Foxconn is having 24 hours shift to meet the demand. I am honestly surprised so many people are buying the new phone
It‚Äôs a new physical design.  And that is usually enough to get more people to consider upgrading
"Shitty battery life = regards need upgrade 

Load up"
Ofc it‚Äôs not shitty battery life. It‚Äôs same as last year‚Äôs pro.
"AAPL is going to crush big time!


GLW is the glass manufacturer for their phones. Should be a really nice upstream effect for AAPL suppliers"
On a technical analysis isn‚Äôt the 50 day going to cross the 200 day any day now which will signal golden cross?
lol people forget even though Apple losing market share it‚Äôs still the most popular phones in the world and gen z is obsessed with Apple. I‚Äôm 32 and I still wouldn‚Äôt ever use any phone than Apple just cause I‚Äôm so used to it.
You may not be old enough to remember this is how people were like with Blackberry. Is anyone still itching for their crackberries? Lol
"A little different, Apple has been dominating for a long time now"
"You're original comment is very incorrect. Android holds about 75% of the market share globally.  So, it's actually quite the opposite globally."
"a third of the world doesn't even have internet access, they don't matter. What matters is what phones people are buying in the West and China where the actual money is"
"Not once did I ever say Apple owns majority of the market in my comment, did I? I just said it‚Äôs popular, the brand is a lot more recognized, yes android is the most owned"
what matters is the younger generation
"BlackBerry in its prime holds nothing compared to Apple.

Even if we just look at phones, there are so many options and they‚Äôve been dominating the space for atleast a decade now. Then we add on the peripheral ecosystem of watches, earbuds, tablets, and laptops. It‚Äôs not even comparable. The Apple ecosystem is a large part of the success of their products atm. 

Compare that to the‚Ä¶ what, 3-5 years people wanted a blackberry? The dominance wasn‚Äôt even as strong when more phones started implementing full keyboards."
"In this economy I don't think people will be lining up for a $2,000 phone"
they will through carrier deals
"Trade in on my 14 Pro gets a 17 Pro with more storage down to ~$450 without changing plans at my carrier. 

Wanted to hold out for a year or two longer but battery‚Äôs going to shit and I‚Äôm tired of the fact it‚Äôs my only device without USB-C."
"And what is the monthly price for your carrier in comparison to the same offer of your carrier without a phone pay off plan? 

There is no such thing as 'free' in this world."
"It‚Äôs a business plan and my line is less than 40 per month for unlimited everything. I live in bumfuck so Verizon historically has been my only option regardless but that may be changing now. 

I agree with your sentiment about no free lunch but my overall point was people stating you had to drop 2K were pretty far off base."
"4 phone line unlimited with new iPhone pro max, 168 included tax. No trade in neither, just 4 free phone flat out. Verizon btw.  Maybe it‚Äôs not free, but close enough."
"Yep I get a new iPhone every 3 years. The deal my carrier gives me makes it pretty much free, I just have to pay sales tax. It is just the old school contract with extra steps."
"&gt;this economy

People say they don't have money precisely because they buy $2000 phones and $500 labubus"
"Oh boy‚Ä¶  the one thing people have with them more than their wallet, keys, loved ones? 

They will find a way to pay for the best one, especially if it matters to them (or the people they want to impress).

Anyway, I‚Äôm poor so mines 256GB in blue and I‚Äôm picking it up on Friday. 

(2-4-1‚Äôs at the dumpster as long as we can get a ü§≥  with the new phone in)."
The Samsung and Google foldable phones are well received. There will be a market for this
I am gonna lose money now on my shiny new orange iphone
Find it funny how poop it is lol. I could never see myself spending that much on the same phoen from the previous year.
I got my order in.
Of all the bullish sentiments. I‚Äôll be definitely be buying shit tons on puts this Monday
This doesn't make any sense. There's nothing special about this phone. It's 95% a spec bump.
"So is every iPhone every year. People are in a 3 year upgrade cycle on average. No one is saying people are rushing to buy these for yearly upgrade. Most people who  upgrade are the ones with 2-3 year old phones. 

Reddit hasn‚Äôt come out of its bubble yet. People are so strongly opinionated that they don‚Äôt think an iota before declaring something as if it‚Äôs universally true."
"Right, not discounting that. OP used the words ""parabolic pre-order numbers"" and ""numbers are going to be stupid high""

My point is there's nothing special here. Nothing was said that makes me believe Apple is returning to its former spot as the most valuable company in the world.

Folks.. Apple is still a great company, but those days (\*Edit to add: as the most valuable company in the world) are over. It's lagging amongst its peers for a reason."
"It‚Äôs a amazing spec bump, it pretty much made the pro model obsolete. Doubling the basic storage to 256 and adding the 120hz screen. It‚Äôs a flagship phone in 2025 for 800 a pop, an absolute value."
Even Canada website was down on pre order day. It‚Äôs kinda crazy!
"In the U.S. I ordered one by 8:30 AM EST on Friday but it was a clunky experience. First it wasn‚Äôt giving an option for store pick up but after 3 attempts, got the order in for a September 19 store pick up"
Dang.. I really thought it was put time
"People saying a 2,000 dollar iPhone is too expensive were saying the same when AirPods first came out."
Apple has technologically shut me out from ever buying the iPhone as they got rid of the sim card tray. Since I travel. I don't know how many there are like me.
eSIM is the most convenient way when travel. So many travel eSIM providers out there you can choose and set up prior to travelling. Some are often offering discount. Better than handling physical SIM cards.
I just posted a post of my thoughts on the new 17 on my profile. This is a shameful release I‚Äôm amazed it getting this much attention
"I have a feeling this year's lineup is going to bomb drastically. They downgraded the enclosure, offer no black or grey in pro models, I love orange but most people don't. The pro models account for 70+% of all phone sales and they're a disaster this year. The wildcard is the air. I think apple has really lost their way the last 2-3years. iPhone OS, version 26 is an abomination as well."
"Gonna do really well actually, and it's probably going to embolden them to drop the foldable ASAP"
